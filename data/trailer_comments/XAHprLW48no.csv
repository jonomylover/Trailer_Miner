2015-03-18T06:17:58,"I feel as if this is one of those movies where the trailer is better than the actual movie itself. While I too am admittedly skeptical, and even willing to go indulge in the cheeziness, I don't really think I'd like to find such a comical effect in a video game movie that this appears to show. What fans want to see is action, and while I sensed a few exciting tidbits here and there, the concept just comes out with an dull reveal.  At first, I was excited to see the trailer, having not seen a video game film since Disney's Wreck-It-Ralph. As a matter of fact, I personally enjoyed Wreck-It-Ralph for the unique, action packed storyline it brought to the table, truly bringing out an exciting concept towards the audience. When I finished seeing the movie, I wanted to watch it again, since I was just that excited from the first second to the ending credits. Sure, part of me could say this due to certain appearances from Sonic, Bowser, and characters in that area. However, despite originally seeing the movie for that reason, I actually fell in love with that plot, which surprised me considering certain character appearances had really urged me to go see it, rather than the initial storyline.  Who knows, I could totally prove myself wrong after seeing the movie, and find out that it's worthwhile. Yet, despite a few moments where I laughed to myself, this trailer provided me with that cheesy, unsatisfying reaction that I despise of with movies. Let's face it, the fans want to see an original and captivating twist in the specific franchises they love.  In the end, this movie could go either way, but I don't see as much success in the long run. I do have lots of high respect in the process that went behind the movie, absolutely. It seems as if the script is lacking in selling to the modern-day audience, I suppose. I'll just wait for Sony to finish up that Sonic the Hedgehog movie they mentioned back in June 2014. Hopefully then that ""live action/CGI film"" will provide more of a modern, action-packed experience without getting too corny.   #QOTD : Any franchises you guys would like to see made into a movie? I've overheard lots of Zelda fans wanting some love. For some reason, I'd like to see a live action film of a *crossover* between Mario and Sonic. That'd definitely be something more exciting, rather than some silly olympic games. :P",6,2,Smirky,XAHprLW48no,0.14863783109545822,2015-03-18 06:17:58,True,True

Okay, I should point out that I really, really hate Adam Sandler. He's an annoying, unfunny and pretentious jackass who thinks anything he puts on screen will get a laugh out of the retarded audiences. Even films like Paul Blart and Bucky Larson he didn't even star in yet I can still blame him for producing them. Happy Madison is basically the comedy equivalent to Platinum Dunes.  So far the only Adam Sandler movie I have ever sat through and genuinely enjoyed was Hotel Transylvania. Sure it's not a great animated film but I still had fun with it and I can actually tolerate Sandler's performance in that movie.... though I still do have some doubts about the sequel.  For once in my damn life, I watched a trailer for an upcoming Adam Sandler movie that is actually very funny. That last bit with the Pac-Man creator made me laugh harder than I ever did before.  Don't get me wrong, this movie can still end up like garbage just like Sandler's other movies(considering one of the writers previously wrote Grown Ups 2) but at the same time there is a small glimmer of hope that this could work.

Then, 11 years later, in 1993, Hollywood Pictures did a live-action video game movie, ""Super Mario Bros."" and it flopped and was panned by critics. Nineteen years later, in 2012, Disney gave us a glimpse inside the video game universe in ""Wreck-It Ralph"", and it was a hit. Now, 3 years later, Columbia is giving us a glimpse of a world where video games come to life in ""Pixels"" because of aliens seeing it as a ""War of the Worlds"" threat (typical). While this movie could a hit in the box office, I predict that critics are not going to like this (probably the acting will screw it up). Plus, the director of this movie is Chris Columbus, the same guy who directed the first 2 ""Home Alone"" movies (my all-time favorite Christmas films), and the first 2 ""Harry Potter"" movies, and all 4 films were big hits with audiences. I hope he hasn't lost his touch in this film.

There are millions of tids who play those games today, most of them have dads or moms who played them though. It is true that they are the minority, but they are there. Also, most kids, I assure you, have played Pacman and Donkey Kong, since they're classic games. Maybe modern versions, but still. Another reason for using pixels is obviously that it's easier to animate. Also, I really don't think there's many modern characters that people have as much a connection with as Pacman, DK etc., so the Pacman scene with the creator wouldn't really make sense to me if it was Master Chief and his creator standing there. They could just have cut that out though. They did not need to make that. But what does it matter what games it is if it's a good story? Execution, guys, that is the key! They could have tried to be more relevant with newer games, but they don't have to. But we don't know if they will, since we have not seen the film yet. Maybe the aliens came and studied it without us knowing it, and created some modern CoD monsters. But I doubt it. Lastly, with the sky-rocketing popularity in old games again, with the Atari Landfill excavation, documentaries about it, the AVGN's sudden fast increase in viewers, with JonTron and Game Grumps, and all these other retro gaming channels/people who have suddenly seen a jump in popularity lately, how can one really say these games are not relevant?

Glasses are very harmful for your eyesight they actually make your vision even more damaged than they were when you first started wearing them. There is a scheme you can take advantage of to get pure and superb 20/20 vision naturally without the use of glasses or contacts. When someones arm is broken do they put on a cast forever and never take it off? No, the arm heals itself over time and returns to normal.  You may not know this but the eye is the strongest muscle in the body, So why is it that when your vision gets bad do they put you in a permanent cast without any hope of removal? The eye CAN and will heal itself if given the proper measures of care.  Listen everybody, This is so important so please  do the best thing you can do for yourself and go and take a more in depth look at this because  The fact is you can get  visually perfect eyesight back and throw away your contacts or your glasses forever",2,1,Get Perfect 20/20 Vision Naturally,XAHprLW48no,0.21239177489177488,2015-03-24 18:24:09,True,True

There is a tactic you can utilize to get crystal clear 20/20 vision naturally without the use of glasses or contacts.  If you broke your arm would you wear a cast forever? Of course not! Your arm would heal and go back to normal given time. Your eyes arethe strongest muscle in the body so why is it when it is harmed and cannot function properly (Imperfect or blurry vision,) do we wrap them up in a permanent cast? The eye CAN and will heal itself if given the proper treatment. Guys, This is  of the utmost of importance so please  do the best thing you can do for yourself and go and  take some time to look into this because it is true you can get crystal clear eyesight back and  get rid of those annoying hard to keep up glasses and annoying contacts for the rest of your life and see perfectly no matter how old you are",1,2,Get Perfect 20/20 Vision Naturally,XAHprLW48no,0.03405797101449276,2015-03-24 22:22:42,True,True

Glasses are terrible for your eyesight they actually make your vision even more  damaged than they were before you ever began to wear glasses. There is a approach you can use to get impeccable 20/20 vision naturally without the use of glasses or contacts. When someone breaks their arm do they wear a cast forever? No, The arm heals and eventually goes back to normal. Out of all the muscles in your body the eye is the strongest, So why is it when your vision becomes harmed do they put you in a permanent cast? The eye CAN and will heal itself if given the proper care.

Graphite is soft enough to form a streak on paper (hence its name, from the Greek word ""γράφω"" which means ""to write""), while diamond is the hardest naturally-occurring material known. Graphite is a very good conductor, while diamond has a very low electrical conductivity.

2015-05-10T03:07:21,"I know it's a trailer, but let me explain the many problems I found through the film's sources.  1. Why would they send a time capsule of everything about Earth? I know that it meant to find aliens and bring peace, but what justice it will do? Do you know how long it takes for a time capsule to leave the Solar System, or miles away from there? It would've taken decades to find life in space. What if the capsule gets destroyed by an asteroid field (like the one in our solar system)? What if it fell into a gas planet, or a deserted, lifeless planet, or a black hole? That time capsule would be pretty much be forgotten, drifting in space for all eternity. This is where all your taxpayer money goes, people!  2. How did the aliens even find us? Did we install coordinates to our planet so they'll find us? How would the aliens know which solar system were on?  3. How did the aliens mistake the time capsule from a ""message of peace"" to a declaration of war? All that information from the capsule would at least intrigued them into visiting us and NOT kill us. I mean, these aliens speak in an extraterrestrial language and don't understand our languages, let alone English. There would be a chance that these aliens would either take decades studying the damn capsule like we do for alien tech OR toss it away/eat it as a means of not giving a shit.  4. The aliens use the games from the time capsule as weapons to attack Earth. If they're capable of creating of something like that, WHY DIDN'T THEY USE THEIR OWN TECHNOLOGY?! These aliens are advanced enough to bring video game characters to life and NOT use their own arsenal?! Is this going to be like After Earth when the movie focuses on the Ursa as the main villain and not the ACTUAL aliens!?  5. and certainly the biggest: WHY ALIENS!? There's so many possibilities you could've done with this idea and you used aliens!? How uninspired are these guys!?  Through these 5 major problems, I'm not going to watch the film, but what I AM going to do is wait for their overall percentage on RottenTomatoes,com. I know people are going to say, ""Dude, it's just a movie, chill,"" but guys! This is the company that brought us Jack and Jill and Bucky Larson: Born to be a Star!   I'm... done ranting.

Watch how Nintendo is trying to sue the company that made the movie and want to have never given the rights to show their games in this movie. Along with Bandai Namco..

You waste how many hours of your life watching Game of Thrones, and Walking Dead, which contains about the same level of realism as most fantasy games, and you have the right to judge other peoples choice entertainment and call theirs a waste of time.  Video games not only give you as complex and emotional plots as movies and Shows, they also allow you to form a deeper bond with the characters because you actually play as that character. And when you loss a team mate in a game you feel the lose even more than a liked character in a movie, because you actually played alongside that character and not just observing from afar, not to mention even decisions you make in a lot of games greatly affect the outcome. Games these days ain't the shit games you old farts played on your Atari and in Arcades, that you gave up as you grew up.

2015-07-25T16:49:14,"This is the FIRST time ever that i post an opinion about a film on a Youtube page. On a web page even. The film was THAT bad. Don't do it to yourself.  This is one of the SHITTIEST movies i've ever seen. SO sorry I hadn't watch the trailer beforehand and only read the plot summary (I thought Columbus would never do a movie that you would regret watching. I might have been watching it for Peter Dinklage, if I knew he would be there. Although I think he's just there for the joy of playing an unapologetic bastard). 1) Although - the trailer is a straight up lie, it's all ""Independence day"" vibe, though the film itself was totally ""Adam Sandler"" (after Hotel Transylvania I thought he is able do a good movie, but no, he's just Adam Sandler) / sitcom / characters throwing personal insults on each other (dressed up as jokes) kind of thing. 2) There wasn't even that much of sfx perks, most of the ""action"" revolved around the characters who SUCK (in every interpretation possible). The game things were... somewhere on the background really. 3) If you consider yourself a feminist - nothing will ever be as painful as this.   Basically - this is the wettest dream of a self-indulgent hikki nerd loser man who has never been satisfied with anything in his life and is still so full of himself that it turns out the only way anyone could be better than him is because they cheat. And I understand the power of fantasy, I know, every other time a movie is about a nobody who saves the world through some of their small personal merit, but this is just a disgrace. ""He liked to slice up kittens and one day it helped him become a hero"" is just one tiny step away from this film, and I personally consider the movie to be an insult to all hikkis, all the sweet nerdy guys, all the people who work hard but just so happen not to have a swanky job and maybe even to all gamers in general (think about that, there are only 3 gamer characters (not including the kid, he has no character) in the film: 1) a dingbat who is positively crazy about a girl game character and who also happens to believe all conspiracy theories that ever existed; 2) an egoistical criminal who cheats; 3) and Adam Sandler at his worst). And the depiction of the relations between men and women is just a slap on the face of any nice person ever.  I honestly don't know what was the purpose of the film. Maybe just getting money, but im not even sure of that.",0,0,MRAakaCR,XAHprLW48no,0.06520833333333334,2015-07-25 16:49:14,False,True

But the negatives are it's still an Adam Sandler movie with jokes that don't work and it doesn't know what it want to be. There are times where it's tries to have kid friend moment, but then it turns into a adult joke.  I'd say your better off renting it at RedBox and skip to the action scenes.

Reign Over Me, The Wedding Singer and Punch Drunk Love to name a few. Sure the films that display his raw anger are memorable, but the ones that diversify Sandler's approach to acting in films are his most successful. It's just a pain that dreck sullies his decent performances more often than not. Grown Ups was acceptable, but the second film was needless, unfunny and boring. Jack & Jill....well the less said the better. Pixels is one of those films where people may need to turn their brain off to enjoy. But maybe playing Saints Row 4 covers all the lunacy this film attempts to replicate. It doesn't matter if you like this film or not, this is what Sandler wants and we'll see a lot more of it in the future because money and the never-ending slew of sophomoric ideas.

The celebrity actors in this film are a bonus, so why is it that all the critics are so aimed towards them?! The movie's isn't about Adam, it's about the Chaos of Video Games Invading Our Planet! Adam's just there because a movie needs characters + Hollywood needs celebrities! They don't even mention Kevin James. Just ""AdAm SaNdLeR bAD AdAm SaNdLeR bAd AdAm SaNdLeR bAd""   I definitely understand why everyone thinks it's bad, but I found the movie fun to watch because I didn't worry so much about the actors, especially in 3D.
