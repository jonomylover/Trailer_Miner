2016-02-08T16:57:33,"*I think a new word needs to be invented for the English language.* I said something similar in the other trailers for this movie. Just hear me out curious readers, you'll either educate me, or if I'm lucky you'll agree with me.   So, what would you call that thing that happens during this trailer, when the Bare Necessities theme starts to play? Please, seriously think about it, I'd like to know. Is there a word for it? It's obviously instantly recognizable to us, and if you're like me, you thought, ""omg...they included that song, that's really, really cool!""   So what's that called? You might say, ""well, I‚Äôm not quite sure what you‚Äôre asking, and why this Youtube comment is so weird and long, but obviously they included that classic song,"" or ""they're kind of redoing something from the past.""   Well, first off, I said ""_word_,"" not a sentence to describe that moment :). The best I can come up with are words like, *""homage,"" ""callback,"" or ""tribute.""* If you wanna stretch it, maybe even ""reference."" The problem with those words are, it doesn't quite have the right connotation. At all. Not even a little bit. It's completely lifeless and devoid of the actual emotional reaction we get when seeing such scenes.   Here's what I mean. It's not as if we would use any of those words and say, ""oh cool, they paid homage to that song,"" or ""haha, nice callback."" No, as soon as the tune started at 1:15, *you probably smiled to yourself, while others who are huge fans may have hunched forward towards their monitors and put their hands to their open mouths, eyes wide with joy and surprise. While even bigger fans may have pushed their feet on the floor to scoot backwards in their office/gaming chairs. Finally, people that saw this in groups, most likely smiled giddily and looked around to silently say, ‚Äúplease tell me you recognized that song!‚Äù*  Whatever the degree of reaction, there's an emotional content there. And again, to describe these moments of *nostalgia*, all we really have is our own emotional reactions for to describe it (just look at the comments here that reference the song...they say things like, *""I got very emotional when the song played,"" or, ""I started to tear up, and I don't know why.‚Äù*).   Well I know exactly why, but I can't think of a word for it, which is the point of this copy paste. We have a lot of words to choose from to communicate thoughts and Ideas. To be as granular and precise as we want, to spin our intentions just the way we want, to put the exact, tiniest connotation on an idea to make our points. But not here. They didn‚Äôt think of a word to describe this type of moment, but they‚Äôre going to have to. As more time passes, the more there are more nostalgic moments that can be referenced as *easter eggs.*  And I just said all this as someone who didn't even particularly care about The Jungle Book. I probably saw it once or twice as a kid, it was good enough, but nothing I thought about since, or had any inclination to go back and watch. But, I am aware of the song. And soon as 1:15 hit, I got chills down my spine and felt emotional.",0,0,iClone Animations,C4qgAaxB_pc,0.16955412419122093,2016-02-08 16:57:33,True,True

""Scrounging for bucks"" comes to mind. Since when did literature, especially childrens' literature, become about profiteering?  This century and a bit novel is now being morphed into an action-thriller with some of the same old morals and drama thrown in as a side note. Disney ought to have let this one alone.

2016-03-05T13:04:27,"It;s a pretty good cast. But I think this would be my dream cast for a remake of the 67 film. As far as I'm concerned, Neel Sethi and Lupita Nyong'o can keep their roles.  Benedict Cumberbatch as Shere Khan. I know he's doing the voice in the Andy Serkis one, but I still think he'd be better for this Shere Khan than Idris Elba. Speaking of which...  Idris Elba as Bagheera. I definetly think Idris would fit Bagheera's stern yet caring personality perfectly. As a matter of fact, I actually thought he was playing Bagheera when I found out he was involved. I'm sure he'll be fine as Shere Khan, but I think it's sort of a wasted oppurtunity.  Either Jeremy Renner or Seth Rogen as Baloo. This is only if I had to choose someone other than Bill Murray. Jeremy Renner can play a laid-back type, and I can just imagine Seth Rogen's voice coming out of a bear. And if I had to be honest, considering that Jon Favreau is known for playing characters in films he directed, I was half-expecting him to play the part.  James Spader as Kaa. The Avengers: Age of Ultron Teaser Trailer should explain why.  Michael Rooker as King Louie. This would only be if Louie was more like the 67 version, because I'm really looking forward to seeing Christopher Walken play the Ape-Father.  Ben Kingsley as Akela. It wouldn't be the first time Sir Ben played a wise Indian leader, would it?  Toby Jones as Haithi. Toby Jones already played that character in Dad's Army, so you'll know why.  Helena Bonham Carter as Winifred. I can't really explain this one. I just think it'd work pretty well. Not to mention, this wouldn't be the first time she took over as a Disney character from Verna Felton.

Recently, Disney has halted nearly ALL of its new original ideas and replaced them with live action recreations of our old childhood favorites like the one I'm commenting on now. And while some of you, even the majority of you approve of these movies, I could not think less of them. They are shallow, soulless copies of a previous generations ideas that, as most other comments will prove, seek only to make a quick dime by preying on your nostalgia. I implore any and everyone reading this NOT to walk blindly into theaters simply because there is a familiar title and a slew of A-class actors. Ticket sales are what have the most impact on studios like Disney, and it is my hope that if enough people reject these recycled stories and demand new ones that they will listen, and produce great works of art once again..

From the animals to the grand jungle set. A true visual feast that is totally ahead of its time. 99% of the film is CGI. 3. Great voice cast. Love Baloo and Bagheera 4. It has that fairy tale Disney feel 5. Neel Sethi (Mowgli) brought so much charm in the movie. He is captivating. What a great actor he is!  6. It has Bare Necessities and I Wanna be Like You. 7. Love the musical score 8. End Credits is amazing. Watch out for it. I won't spoil. Disney fans will love it. It's a true tribute to the classic Disney. 9. The movie has a big heart.

The _actual_ Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling. How many kids who've seen the film don't even know that exists? There's so many great ideas in the original Jungle Book that never get used! Hey, did you know they basically swapped the characters for Baloo and Bagera? Yeah, Baloo is the hard-ass originally who teaches the law. Bagera can hold his own pretty well, but basically just wants to chill all day. Kaa is the worst offender! He's the complete opposite of a villain. He's not only friendly, but rescues Mowgli several times. He's a complete badass who commands fear and respect and everyone's kind of amazed that Mowgli has managed to stay friends with him without getting killed. Hey remember that lil song and dance scene with the monkey king? That's bullshit. The entire _point_ of the monkeys is that they have no leader. They're half-insane idiots who doup Mowgli into being their leader for about a day before they get bored.  If you're going to go to all the effort of re-making The Jungle Book, why not use these good ideas?? It's not like they couldn't be translated into film. They absolutely could. I'm not even saying you need an exact re-creation of the book, but why do you need to *shit* on your source material? Some parts I wouldn't put in a Jungle Book movie. That part where Mowgli guts and skins a tiger and dances naked on his corpse in the moonlight? Yeah, maybe don't put in that part. Or the part where Kaa just murders everyone for holding Mowgli captive. If you want the good stuff like that... well... the book's public domain so you don't even need to pay for it. You can find it online easily. It's not super long and is easy to read.",1,0,Joey Wolf,C4qgAaxB_pc,0.14662990196078435,2016-04-09 02:47:42,False,True

Considering everyone one of those involve the animal simply opening and closing their mouth quickly, I'm not impressed. Doubt they can pull that off for an entire movie. And the snake! Not only is the voice acting not even close, but the snake doesn't even open its mouth!   The entire basis of this trailer is to show that 1.

2016-05-15T03:16:18,"I thought this movie was really good, but I just have two complaints. 1) I realize that the music in the Jungle Book is nostalgic, but they should have either made a much better effort with the songs or cut them out of the movie entirely. Both songs, especially King Louie's ""I Wanna Be Like You"" was absolutely half-assed, like they barely put any effort into them. It seemed like they were just trying to force the songs into the film instead of them having a natural place and actually being good. 2) Mowgli should have gone back to the man village like in the 1956 animated version. This one just felt...incomplete. They added on parts to the story (which I actually thought were great), but they needed that ending.  Honorable mention complaint: I guess I don't really see the need to switch Kaa from male to female. It doesn't really change or affect the story any, but I just don't see the point.",0,0,gnc623,C4qgAaxB_pc,0.14722222222222225,2016-05-15 03:16:18,False,True

2016-10-28T18:24:10,"d on Rudyard Kipling‚Äôs timeless stories and inspired by Disney‚Äôs classic animated film, ‚ÄúThe Jungle Book‚Äù is an all-new live-action epic adventure about Mowgli (newcomer Neel Sethi), a man-cub who‚Äôs been raised by a family of wolves. But Mowgli finds he is no longer welcome in the jungle when fearsome tiger Shere Khan (voice of Idris Elba), who bears the scars of Man, promises to eliminate what he sees as a threat. Urged to abandon the only home he‚Äôs ever known, Mowgli embarks on a captivating journey of self-discovery, guided by panther-turned-stern mentor Bagheera (voice of Ben Kingsley), and the free-spirited bear Baloo (voice of Bill Murray). Along the way, Mowgli encounters jungle creatures who don‚Äôt exactly have his best interests at heart, including Kaa (voice of Scarlett Johansson), a python whose seductive voice and gaze hypnotizes the man-cub, and the smooth-talking King Louie (voice of Christopher Walken), who tries to coerce Mowgli into giving up the secret to the elusive and deadly red flower: fire. The all-star cast also includes Lupita Nyong'o as the voice of the fiercely protective mother wolf Raksha, and Giancarlo Esposito as the voice of wolf pack‚Äôs alpha male Akela. ‚ÄúThe Jungle Book‚Äù seamlessly blends live-action with photorealistic CGI animals and environments, using up-to-the-minute technology and storytelling techniques to immerse audiences in an enchanting and lush world. The wild adventure swings into theaters in 3D on April 15, 2016.",0,0,Niles Aburage,C4qgAaxB_pc,0.1869047619047619,2016-10-28 18:24:10,False,False
