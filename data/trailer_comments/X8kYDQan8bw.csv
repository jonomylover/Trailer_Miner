2015-03-11T16:48:02,"Nightcrawler is a really GOOD movie-model that all movies should look up to as a big brother - not like those pointless action movies. It makes you question how fucked up our society is. You will leave the movie questioning reality. The ending to it is really fucked up and it really questions the human condition. It questions what it means to be human - and quite possibly answers the meaning of life/existence. It's one of the best, eye-opening movies I have ever watched regarding how twisted and dark the lifestyle society sets out for you is. You're just left questioning the world man lol. It gets deeply philosophical you're left with a bunch of questions. Yeah, you should basically just make movies with that stir up DEEP questions about morality/life/existence/society; movies like: Nightcrawler Movie, Fight Club, Braveheart, All is Lost, 7 Psycopaths, Falling Down (1993), End of Watch, Oldboy (2003), The Silence of the Lambs, City of God, Snowpiercer, Bad Santa, American Gangster, ¬†12-Years a slave, Django Unchained, Good Will Hunting, Children of Men, No Country for Old Men, The Departed, True Grit, Drive (2011), Moon (2009 Movie), Prisoners, The Place Beyond the Pines, 127 Hours, and Traffic (2000) - are the type of movies we should watch. (Tyler Durden from Fight Club is a good role model that we should all look up to btw) ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ *Plot Spoiler alert* for Nightcrawler ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ Okay, so the main character is basically a robot. He's a product of society. All he cares about is making MONEY and expanding the company he is creating. He's incapable of feeling anything, nothing, ¬†no emotion at all (well he's only capable of being mad and angry if people get in the way of him making money, or if he encounters person that poses a potential threat to his company). Business is immoral man, it really corrupts the mind of people. It makes people just do it for the money; (Getting the most. getting more more more than anyone else), making them fight with each other and pointlessly compete with one another.¬†  Lou starts off as a loser that has nothing. No job. No money. Nothing at all (he's a loser in the eyes of society). Well he makes enough money to survive and is poor - but he feels guilty about it and wants to make MORE money (he's thinking in terms of society here).¬†  Well anyways Lou basically starts a video recording company where he just records violent crime scenes happening in real time, and sells the footage to some newscast production company where they show live crime scenes happening on the news. I mean he's literally just recording people kill each other, and he FEELS NOTHING at all for the people being killed. It's just messed up. Like he recorded like 5 people being killed, and he was like there witnessing the people that were being killed, and he did nothing to stop the murders too; he doesn't even release parts of the tape that expose the murderers - he just lets the murderers live on and kill more people so he can get more footage to sell for the newscast company. Then the newscast ratings go up because people love seeing people die on the news. What he's doing, however, makes him earn a lot of $. He likes the company he starts because he sees huge potential in it and there's a really good market for $. Well, he becomes so fixated upon making $ and expanding his company that it totally takes over his mind-set/morality over how he views everything. He cares about the expansion of his company and making $, and doesn't care AT ALL for the well-being of his employees. There was this one scene in the movie where he sets up one of his employees to be killed (because that employee was a threat to his company) and he just filmed his employee being killed. Then he took that footage and sold it to the newscast company to broadcast to the news channel and he earns $ and he becomes happy.  At the end of the movie, Lou is viewed as successful (in the eyes of society), because his company expands and he starts making wayy more $. It really gives you the message that society values business and profit more than the well-being of humans - whoever makes the most $ in this world receives more recognition, and everyone looks up to those people. It doesn't matter HOW you make money; whether you harm people or not, whether you force people to do things that they don't feel like doing - the only thing that matters is whether the money (the end-goal). Society makes us chase an empty goal (making money) and makes us totally forget the journey of life. Life is about the journey, not the destination. Society makes you forget about the journey, and makes you value the destination.  Modern society (sorry if I'm using the word society so much - I just feel that it emphasizes the point I am trying to make here) only makes us focus on winning/succeeding. It only makes us focus on ONE outcome. What's wrong with losing/failing? I mean, when people just focus on ONE outcome like succeeding, it just puts hella pressure on them and creates a lot of stress. And the people that fail are treated like shit and are looked down upon. Why can't we treat those that fail/succeed equally... It makes life LESS STRESSFUL that way. To expand upon my point further I'll use an analogy (using Daoist Philosophy), life is basically like a river. You should just flow through the river and surrender yourself to the current; let it take you and you will live life in peace. You swim against the current when you focus on success/failure - it's wasted effort and just makes your life more stressful. If you ignore the concepts of winning/losing - then you let the current take you and you just flow~ Well, society makes you FOCUS on swimming against the current. You aren't really enjoying the river ride when you swim against the current, it just makes you tired. Just relax and let the current take you. Have fun enjoying the ride that is the river. Just forget society. I think the reason why society makes you focus on swimming against the current is because it's easier to control you that way win you focus on swimming against the current. It's fucked up",0,0,Christian Celeste,X8kYDQan8bw,0.07007823331352743,2015-03-11 16:48:02,False,False

2015-04-16T06:37:11,"A theory and comparison paralleling Nightcrawler with End of Watch (for fun). **Warning, spoilers**  Both movies feature a character played by Jake Gyllenhaal. Both characters are polar opposites of each other. Both movies also feature the use of cameras to film crime. Both feature¬†the death of a companion.¬†  What if both Brian Taylor in End of Watch and Louis Bloom in Nightcrawler are the same person, only in different realities?¬† The character Jake plays in End of Watch hints back to his past of being in the Marine Corps. Maybe during his time as a Marine, Jake had a traumatizing experience - one that would either lead to a life of righteousness and service for others or a life of being alone, disconnected from humanity, and service only to himself. Throughout the films, the cameras are used to film crime. In End of Watch, crime is filmed as truth for other policemen and those who serve justice as the truth to what happened in a situation. However, in Nightcrawler any footage of crime is subject to Lou's editing, and whatever truth to a situation that can indict him of his own crimes is simply edited out.¬† Both films feature characters that differ in the way they view and interact with people. ¬†In End of Watch, he is a good friend who would protect Jake's character Brian Taylor just as Brian would do for him, too. Brian is laid back (a little more than Lou) and socializes with the rest of his colleagues in a friendly manner. He is married. He also plays jokes and has quite the personality. Lou on the other hand is cold and calculated. It is revealed that Lou is alone, misanthropic, and merely thinks of people as pawns to use for his own benefit.¬† In both endings, a friend dies. In End of Watch, Brian and his friend fight for each other, but due to unfortunate circumstances, Brian's friend sacrifices himself for him. However, the duo is successful in bringing the rest of the Calvary of the LAPD to end the criminals' reign of terror. However in Nightcrawler, Lou successfully sacrifices his friend in order to film something so profitable that he can then expand in his own business. Lou merely feeds off of the terror that happens in the streets of LA and would either stand by and watch, or orchestrate it.¬† In sum, Jake Gyllenhaal's characters could be subject to some sort of trauma that made the character choose either a side that would fight the evil in this world with his many brothers and sisters in the police force, or a side that would destroy any good left within him and feed off the evil to establish dominance in a world for himself.",0,0,Jpjohnnyp,X8kYDQan8bw,0.022860360360360363,2015-04-16 06:37:11,False,False

When his partner accussed him of not understanding people, he responded by saying ""what if i understand people but i just don't like them"".This for me is practically the whole theme of the movie. He knows people well, he knows how to get people to trust him and he at times knows more about people than they know about themselves. He uses this understanding to manipulated people to serve his will. He sees people as nothing more than a means to an end. I remember reading about a psychological study conducted on the top CEO's in America and the majority of them were found to have had psychopathic tendancies and this movie perfectly demonstrates how useful these tendancies can be to anyone who aims to reach the very top in this society.
