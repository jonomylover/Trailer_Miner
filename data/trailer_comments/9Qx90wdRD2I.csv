2017-05-20T14:46:40,"It seems to me like someone scoured Europe, mostly England, very closely to find such a case of Black people in a Caucasian nobility. Dido's mother was a slave of a Spanish slave ship round the Caribbean. Her father died with no legitimate heirs and left what he could to her.  It's ok that they portrayed the English and Europe to be racist, they absolutely were and in most cases are, it is realistic and a reality. I think the movie would have been better had they not ridiculed her Caucasian cousin at every turn. You can tell a black person made this movie. The white, very rich, titled, and very BEAUTIFUL Lords didn't want to marry her (although they would pick her above all other nobility) because of their prejudice and other people's prejudice although they found her beauty to be so great. Give me a break. The maker of this movie didn't do justice there. The maker should have been a lot harsher on the white people for their racism but not by this ridiculousness of making them act ridiculous but by actually showing more of the disgust and reproach they felt. During this time people couldn't even stand to be in the same room with a black person, wouldn't even hire them. The servants were worse snobs too. To the world, they were a slave breed. And it would take a very liberal sort of person, with peculiar tastes to view them as equals or marry them. An anomaly at that time. And you'd only see white men marrying black or mixed woman, not the other way around, because guys like a damsel in distress and for woman to be beneath them anyway, especially during that time. If a white girl married a black man it had to be because he was very rich and she poor so you never saw this.  Also, I think Dido should also have been portrayed just a little snob-like at times too. She must have noticed her family's standing was higher than others.  If only black people, mostly westernized black people, were more proud of Africa, you would see many films of black people in Africa during this same time period, but I never find dramas or novellas like those.",1,1,LemonDrop,9Qx90wdRD2I,0.11004901960784315,2017-05-20 14:46:40,False,False
