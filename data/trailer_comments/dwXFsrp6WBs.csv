Like one fellow said before, it's been nearly 30 years since the Turtles came out. They're still going strong (the new Nickelodeon series is great.) Of course, it's not going to be like the original cartoon, or the movies, or the source comics. This is a new adaptation, so it's going to differ from anything you've seen before. If it weren't, what point would there be in making it? It'd be redundant, so reserve your thoughts until after you've seen this new take on the heroes in a half shell.

The TMNT franchise has known several major incarnations, so there are some significant differences already: http://turtlepedia.wikia.com/wiki/Comparisons_within_Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles  The ORIGINAL TMNT come from Mirage comics. The comic book really wasn’t made for kids, they were filled with graphic violence, including blood spray, stabbings and ritualistic suicide. But when Playmates Toys expressed interest in producing TMNT action figures in 1986, the comic’s PG-13 attitude wouldn’t fit Playmates' 4-8 year old target audience. In addition, part of Playmates’ marketing was an animated cartoon, which had to pass television censors. So to make the Turtles viable for children, the Turtles had to soften up.  source: http://mentalfloss.com/article/30862/complete-history-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles  There you have it, before bashing anything, at least know what you're talking about. The cartoon from the 80's changed many things from the original TMNT comics, it was dumbed down for kids, you could say it was the first ""rape"" of the turtles. The live action movies have been very mediocre so far and this one seems ready to join the club, but time will tell.",1,0,SirMikelangelus,dwXFsrp6WBs,0.13946854912764006,2014-06-25 02:07:06,True,True

Shredder also looks pretty fantastic himself. Some of the jokes and dialogue feel quirky (reminiscent of transformers saga) but thats just the way he does his films. The worst part of this is megan fox. She doesnt act her scenes well, and I think a redhead would have been better suited for this role.

But the main major one for me is the total different personality around the turtles in their speaking. They had a cool more beach bum youthful voice (of ignorance) like that of the west coast cliche while Splinter was a very much Asian-style wise teacher. I didn't really get that but more of a ghetto urban, hipster style behavior. I guess more fitting for modern New York, but just not that quirky funny thing about it that was highly attractive.  I think they just applied the Hollywood formula of throwing money at it for making it a visual spectacle instead of putting a well thought, DEEP story into it. I don't mind the high action, exaggeration visuals of modern Hollywood though, I just hate the ignoring of committing to great original plots, character stories and overall storytelling quality.

Shredder's design looks like it was done by a twelve year old (we get it, he's Shredder, he doesn't need 100 blades sticking out everywhere though). The Foot Clan uses guns now, because that's apparently what ninjas do in 2014. And why does every main character have to be CGI?? If they could pull off suits and puppets over 20 years ago, imagine what they could do today. But instead we get Teenage Mutant Transformers with Magneto/Megatron Shredder and Megan Fox doing her permanent O-face in every reaction shot.   I know TMNT has always been campy, but there is such a thing as subtlety people. At the end of the day they're suppose to be ninjas (from the turtles to Shredder and the Foot), and NONE of them look, feel or act like ninjas. This trailer is just a bunch of loud noises, explosions and dubstep. If you can get excited for that, more power to you. But don't bitch about other people who don't like the way this film looks.

At the time I couldn't believe such a cool idea could even exist.I grew up with the cartoons and when the movie hit, they just got even better. Most everybody can say they were THE biggest turtle fan, but I really was. I collected nearly every action figure till about the mid 90's and loved the video games.         I watched this trailer and that little kid in me, who loved the ninja turtles, just died. The Hollywood rape machine just keeps getting stronger. A batman reference, A personality that says ""super creepy"" like a teenage girl would, A shredder that looks and sounds like a transformer (go figure), The Foot-clan using machine guns and driving around in pimped out escalade's and hummers. bad voice acting and CG turtles (really?). Humor that is just awful and I do mean horribly awful. Everybody has their opinions on things, who really cares. But, if you think this is a good thing, you are definitely part of the problem. I haven't set foot in a theater in years, and after seeing this trailer I am pretty sure I never will again. It is most definitely going to get worse from here.

Shredder was more of a petulant, whiny Saturday morning antagonist like so many others in the 80s instead of a proper villain.

I'm tired of trailers spoiling a lot though. They didn't show The Shredder's face, which is good, and I like The Shredder's armor, looks badass & it makes sense, people actually use guns in this Ninja Turtles movie, it best to have armor. In fact, it makes perfect sense that the Foot Clan uses guns, this Ninja Turtles movie is set in Modern Day, think how easily the Turtles could've been taken out in the original films if even one Foot Ninja had a gun.  I like the Turtles' new looks, especially Donatello's, the voices fit each character, especially the voice for Raphael. I must say, the Turtles & Splinter being CGI, its a lot better than Animatronics. I liked the original films, 1 & 2 anyway, not 3, as much as the next person, but its clear those Animatronics wouldn't work nowadays, CGI is the best choice, and it will nice to see Splinter kicking ass just like it was good to see Yoda kick ass.  The actor playing Shredder in this is white, which does suck, but think about this, remember in Iron Man 3, the person who we thought was The Mandarin, really wasn't The Mandarin. Well, what if that's the case here? This Shredder isn't the real Shredder, but someone Oroku Saki wants people to believe is Shredder, so if he gets caught, Oroku Saki could be elsewhere with a backup plan, maybe they show is face after the end credits. This a *big* What-if, but after what happened with The Mandarin in Iron Man 3, I wouldn't be surprised if something similar happened here.  It still baffles me why the hell Megan Fox of all people, was picked for the role of April O' Neil, they didn't even make her a redhead in this.

Michael Bay is just the producer, the turtles still have their personalities, Splinter looks adorable, good chance of Oroku Saki being in it at 1:15, the're not aliens, *They even made fun of that at the end*, still some good jokes in the movie instead of being all dark, and lastly the TMNT are being the TMNT.

2014-06-28T03:18:52,"Ok let's be completely honest here. What is the first thing that comes to mind when you think of ninja turtles in general? Seriously just think. It's something around the lines of turtles fighting shredder or the krang while chilling and eating pizza. Visually you probably pictured them as the 90's cartoon or the original Jim Henson animatronics. Whatever version you thought about it pretty much defines who they are. If you're going to pull the old ""this is true to the original comics that were dark and gritty"" card out you have to take into account that not many people knew about the original ninja turtle comic's at all. Hell those were printed in cheap newspaper esque material and are really rare to find nowadays.   The ninja turtles in their peak were a commercialized wet dream. After the comics they became the turtles we know today. A lot of interpretations deviated from the original comics but they kept the recurring principle of cheesy jokes, over the top villains, pizza appetite and the overall design they shared from the 90's cartoon. It was the identity that everyone knew them as. And even the new Nickelodeon show stays true to these aspects. So it stands to reason that an ultimate brute redesign like this would spur the fans out.  I'm still keeping an open mind to watch this film but my only real gripe is that the characters and the story itself just doesn't look interesting at all. Just another generic action flick",9,6,Fractorification,dwXFsrp6WBs,0.13832442067736184,2014-06-28 03:18:52,True,True

2014-06-29T12:47:56,I think it's gonna be horrible too but I'll be damned if I don't go see it like half the people on this thread.  There will never be a real TMNT movie because it would never come close to the blood and gore of the original comics.  The Hollywood rating system wouldn't allow for it.  As for those people who say that it looks too CGI?  WTF did you expect?  The movie is about GIGANTIC TURTLES THAT ARE NINJAS.  Get over that.  The real giant talking turtles were all booked I'm sure.  They went with what they had.  I do have issues with the casting but whatever.  My kids should like it.,0,0,Joseph Johnson,dwXFsrp6WBs,-0.08452380952380954,2014-06-29 12:47:56,True,True

2014-06-30T03:27:44,I think it looks awesome. I don't have a problem with Michael bay at all. I loved the transformers movies. Everybody always complains bc it's not exactly how they want it. Everybody always wants exactly what they want and they are never satisfied. Even when something is done the way they want it they complain for another reason. People are complaining bc the turtles don't look like the ones in the 90s films but if they looked just like them they'd complain they are too similar and that Michael bay isn't original. If you don't like him don't watch it and then complain it's bad. You know even if you did like it you'd say it's bad so you can say I told you he'd ruin it. And don't be like the douche bag who said buy a ticket for another movie and then go see it. If you want to see it pay for the fuckin movie and go see it. Stop bitching people and watch the movie for what it is and stop whining that it's not exactly how you want it. It's a different take on the ninja turtles and it's awesome we are finally getting new movie based on them. Watch the movie and then if you don't like it say what's wrong with it and don't be a fuckin douche bag and say it's bad bc your following everybody else who doesn't like Michael bay. ,0,0,Bryan Dedon,dwXFsrp6WBs,0.031186868686868714,2014-06-30 03:27:44,True,True

Your heating on this big time and the movie has not even came out jet, everyone been heating on this sense last year pretty much, now I will say that when Bay said it was going to be about aliens I flip out as everyone else cause there not aliens there freaking turtles!! Form earth!! He got the message so he change it back the way is suppose to be so I was really happy with that. When it came this year and show how they look I was not really sure if I like how they look jet but know I'm use to the look and I like it and I like the trailers and it seems its going to be an awesome movie but I'm not getting my hopes up cause the movie can turn out bad and I really hope it those not cause I love the turtles there part of my life when I was growing up I'm worry about it as you guys are all the turtle fans. But I got to say STOP BITCHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE!!!! IT HAS NOT COME OUT FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!! If you guys saying this movie sucks and all that you most had seen the movie already, so please tell us everyone on here why is it so bad about this movie and how it ruin the turtles please were dying to know!? If you don't know haven't seen the movie, THEN SHUT THE F**** UP, STOP BITCHING ABOUT THE MOVIE THAT HAS NOT CAME OUT JET, STOP HEATING ON THE ACTOR'S YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THEM PERFORM IN THIS MOVIE JET AND STOP BITCHING ABOUT HOW THE TURTLES LOOK BUT I WILL ADMIT THERE FACES WITH THERE NOISE LOOKS REALLY WIRED. Look I know how you turtle fans feel no ones like changes, especially when it comes something we love from our child hood, but some changes are good you guys they just want to make more amazing for use fans, come one some point in time when we were growing up we thought of how the turtle could look like different, I seen I lot of fan made drawings on Google image of the turtles being different for example: I saw that someone drew the turtles being humans and how they act at school and what type of friends they hang out with, I thought that was pretty cool and other like it too. All I'm saying is that you should gave this movie a changes see of first then Give your thoughts and opinion on the movie don't hate on it with out giving it a try cause you don't know if you might like it and might turn out really awesome, then you will feel stupid for saying all the bad stuff about it later, some of you did the same thing with the avengers I'm I right don't lied? Look how that movie turn out it blow are freaking minds of how good it was. So stop bitching about this movie it just a trailers you guys is not the full movie, so when the movie comes out and we all see it then you can say what ever you want about the movie if its good or bad whatever its your thoughts but stop heating on this trailer this trailer is not the movie so stop bitching it.",0,0,DiscMaster Gaming Grid,dwXFsrp6WBs,0.12443871645880575,2014-07-01 01:42:35,True,True

The fact they are doing something different  with the turtles and not the same thing they did last time. I love the turtles and am a huge fan. But I don't want them to repeat and make the same movies over and over. This movie looks good, it gives us a different view of the turtles. Like Megan playing April, they are going back to the original black haired April and not the red head. (If u read the original comics she had black hair.). This is my opinion so please not hate. Also a good fan would give it a chance before judging it based on a trailer. That's what my dad taught me. :) ",1,0,J.D Robinson,dwXFsrp6WBs,0.2345833333333333,2014-07-03 08:02:48,True,True

2014-07-03T09:52:44,"Lets be honest haters, It's extremely difficult to take something as silly as mutant humanoid turtles from a cartoon show, and make it photo realistic without encountering problems in the original design. In animation, it's easier to make the designs look natural when compared to everything around them, Most residents of NYC in the show are normal humans, of course, and the turtles are not. But because it's a cartoon, the features of many normal humans are exaggerated, and therefore look unrealistic, and therefore don't look out of place when they encounter the turtles. In regards to the turtles themselves, because they are animated, there are certain details you can get away with not showing. For example, because live action often has to look photorealistic with live action cg creations, there are more details that can be, and often must be, shown on a cgi creation, such as sweat, the movement of their bandanas against their bodies etc. In animation(More specifically the 87 series) you don't really see scales on the turtles, and as a result it just looks like green skin, and the sweat is often just big cartoonish sweat beads. The turtles in the new movie definitely look jarring and out of place next to the humans, as well as their 87 designs, but that's the point, they are meant to look out of place and strange because they ARE out of place and strange. and I can still recognize who they are, both in look and in personality. Raph seems like Raph, Donatello seems like Donatello and so on.  I don't see the problem here in all honesty, and for those who want to explain to me why they don't like it, feel free, I like discussion and debate, just, as a point of challenge, explain it to me without mentioning your pessimism due to Michael Bay's involvement, and tell me if you would hate it as much if he had nothing to do with the production of the film.  ",0,0,RocketAdrenaline4220,dwXFsrp6WBs,0.04645300935623515,2014-07-03 09:52:44,True,True

2014-07-04T20:30:52,"I will try to make my 2 cents short and sweet for you all: 1) I love the look of the turtles. I like how they used clothes and other items that were probably thrown out to give them each their distinct personality. A few people have a problem that the turtles don’t have the rounded snout but i'm glad that they don’t because realistically turtles have nostrils instead of that rounded snout. I wish they retouched Mike’s face but I can live with that, but I think they went over the top with Donatello’s tech gear. Having a utility belt and a gadget on his forearm will do the trick because the tech gear on his shell will most likely brake in the first fight scene. 2) I think they also went over the top with shredders armor, but I hope his use some martial arts and not fight like a transformer in the entire movie. At first I was kind of skeptical about the foot clan using guns but you have to think it, they probably recruited convicts, and people off the street that don’t know how the properly to use a martial art weapons. I hope they recruited a couple of swordsman. 3) But the things a really hate about the film is that its nickelodeon film. Granted the movie is targeting a younger audience but the movie has knife and guns I just hope I will see a little blood shed. I want see Leo and Ralph was their weapons not just for self-defense. I hope Michael Bay thought the fans that grew up watching them and now we are young adults like me by having a little gore in the firm.

Do you remember how just plain silly the Jim Henson variants were? The Foot were profiting off stolen VHS's, NYC never had complaints of a hocky masked street fighter, and in the 90's cartoon they went through practically a series involving time travel. I grew up watching those films and looking back... they are pretty damn bootleg. Give them credit for awesome costume designs and sure it's in cgi but obviously they didn't want to pull a ""Grinch"" and make grown men look like Whos in this film. Point and case is this. YES this is designed for a new generation. YES the casting could be better. Yes there is CGI for things that obviously normal actors can't do. That avalanche/snow chase? This isn't Lone Survivor wear people in turtle outfits can be tumbling down in... This is coming from one of the guys who really didn't like Transformers and other films that ""ruin"" the childhood. Sure, yes,Transformers really didn't need 2 scenes of dogs humping each other let alone have a transformer insistent to hump Megan Fox's leg. As far as I can tell they don't have that kind of crude humor in this film. From the guy who said ""this looks fucking stupid"" when it was trailed. I'm willing to take my kid sister to see this. Why? She'll like the pop culture references. She wouldn't get the Caesco (pardon the error) bat jokes from TMNT 1990... Sure I wish the design was moooore... turtle-ish but it still looks something similar to the 90's cartoons I'd bum up and watch with my dad on Saturday mornings. Sure I wish the Foot didn't seem like a PMC group but nevertheless it's still the disgusting bootleg thing I remember. I'm sorry you can't argue a ""pepperoni and ice cream pizza"" from the first episode of the 1987 series. Point and case is, if you think this looks weird take a LONG gander at the franchises history.

And of course they had to cast a white man to play shredder, I was confused about that when I first read about it but now I understand because this shredder looks like he has no fighting skills and basically relies on his super armor.

In the previous TMNT movies, I think the the Turtles were made to look how they appeared in the cartoons and comics. But here, they look realistic.  But still quite some complaints though, namely: 1) Shredder. He was a japanese guy. Here, he's an american. Plus, he seems to rely heavily on high-tech armor for fighting  rather than martial skills.  2) April o Neil. Megan fox has lost her charm. She was in her ""prime"" during ""Transformers"" (no pun intended) but now she's not that attractive. Even she doesn't have the characteristic red hair that April has. Even the little bit of acting that we see from Megan in the trailers doesn't remind you of the April we know. 3) The costumes of Turtles are bit ridiculous, except for Leonardo's. Maybe the other three also could have similar costumes. 4) The foot soldiers seem to be gun-totting hoodlums, not ninjas.

Most of the people are saying he blows just because that's what the cool kids are doing. I'm not a Michael Bay fan but, as far as special effects driven blockbuster directors go, he's average in the worst case and most of his films have been commercial succeses, so he must be doing something right (at the end of the day, making lots of money is the main goal for this type of movie, this is not some artistic indie experimental film or a movie to take consideration for the oscars. Another thing, MICHAEL BAY ISN'T DIRECTING He's one of the SIX producers of the film. The quality of the film is about 95% directing AND screenplay, both of wich Michael Bay has nothing to do with. Lastly, GROW THE FUCK UP, this isn't ruining your memories from 1900's TMNT with the Vanilla Ice soundtrack, and if it is the dont fucking watch it. Simple as that. Nobody, let alone studios, give a fuck about your nostalgia. Times change, technology change, people change, markets change. 1900's TMNT wouldn't succeed this day and age, so they have to make a movie made for this era. And also, do you really think that if you were to watch the 1900's TMNT for the first time being an adult you would actually enjoy it? The only reason people enjoy those old films now is because it takes them back. They bring good memories and nostalgia. So stop fucking complaining.

But I wanted to be fair. I wanted to give this movie a chance. I saw the movie a few days ago... And it was, honest to God, one of THE WORST movies I have ever seen in my life. I didn't like the Turtles before this movie. And now I just despise them. They looked horrible in this movie. It was like looking at Dr Eggman in Sonic the Hedgehog 2006. It just wasn't right.  People may hate this, but I'm gonna say it.... They suck as superheroes. Just watching them get their asses kicked in this movie was just painful to watch. They are the worst group of Action Heroes I have ever seen in my life. Only 2 characters did I give half a shit about: Will Arnett's character, and Splinter. To me, there were the only vaguely interesting. And they barely did anything in this movie.  Christ, I didn't even like the first 2 Ninja Turtles movies... But I'd watch them any day over this movie.  But I know what some people are going to say. ""You can't judge this movie properly because you're not a major Ninja Turtles fan!""  Well, the person I saw this movie with, my girlfriend, just happens to be a Ninja Turtles fan. She's probably watched all the Ninja Turtle movies and cartoons out there.... And even she hated this movie. She was literally stunned silent at the end. And not in a good way.   Bottom Line: This movie sucked for me. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Right up there with Walking With Dinosaurs on the level of suckitude.  The plot was boring and all over the place. The backstory to the Turtles and Splinter was uninteresting. The other characters are uninteresting. The turtles looked horrible. They suck at fights, and protecting civilians. They suck at humor (Only one of their lines in this movie was vaguely hilarious). They are painful and embarassing to watch whenever they're in action. Never again will I watch this movie.  Honestly.... you know what? Fuck the Ninja Turtles. They are simply the worst. I didn't like the first Avengers movie.... And yet I'd rather watch that. Or the Power Rangers. Or Superman. Or Hancock.

If they would have kept the Japanese origin, found a better April who I still say to this day should have been played by (so fine and lol, I'm a black dude btw)Christina Hendricks from Mad Men. Chose something other than CGI, like really bad azz suits again with fight scenes like Ninja Assassin, wooh, dude. The movie could have became a classic. As much as I like the Transformer movies, again, for what they are, uh, lets just say you could truly tell Michael Bay was behind this. All flare and no substance.

Say what you want about Bay, but he knows how to make them cool. Ninja badassry everywhere, with a notable lack of pointless explosions. The characterisation of the turtles. They kept the teenage tenancies (like the beatboxing) in there as well as their base personalities most reminiscent of the 2003 series and the 1990 first movie and as always provided a slightly different interpretation in how to present them. They're still the turtles we love guys. Arnett's acting. It was amongst the best in the film, and it was a pleasant surprise seeing the character of Vernon return after over a decade.    HATED: Fox's acting. She rarely had an array of expressions or emotion in her voice, so when she did actually act it felt out of place and awkward for the thus far emotionless character with nothing but her obsession for reporting going for her. She wasn't over-sexualised in this movie like transformers (thank god), but there was also generally too much focus on her in the first third of the movie in order to make the plot go forward, when we just wanted to see more of the turtles. The Shredder's and Karai's average villian treatment. Sacks is given a lot more development and focus than shredder, which makes old bucket-breath seem like he was just slapped in there, no matter how cool his armour ended up being. Karai as well is just a chick who commands the mooks, whereas in other incarnations she's almost always on equal or greater footing in ninja skills than the turtles, so it's disappointing we never saw her fight. The Foot in general. So they're not a super secret ninja clan with a respectful public face, but rather a modern crime organisation hell bent on money. WITH GUNS. And they're WELL KNOWN. How they even do stuff without getting caught is anyone's guess.    UNSURE: The edited origin. So they were laboratory experiments that purposely mutated them instead of the (frequently) accidental creation via alien substances. In this respect it's similar to the IDW comics (made after nick's purchase of the turtles), so it wasn't completely new. You can always say the original origin is the best, but this origin does give the turtles a bigger connection to April.  Splinter not being Hamato Yoshi. Well in the 2003 series he's just a super intelligent (and ordinary) rat that learned ninjutsu by watching Yoshi before he got mutated, so the fact that in this his mutated self learned it by reading books is in a way marginally more believable. It would have been possible to have Yoshi as part of the laboratory professors, but then you gotta answer why he's in america, whether he has a connection to the shredder, how he got mutated when the turtles got mutated by injection and so on. So for the sake of the plot that they chose, it works.  The turtle's design and choice of motion capture. They either look awesomely realistic for humanoid turtles, with their unique builds like the 2012 series and personalised clothing. OR they look a bit too deep into the uncanny valley to be lovable and basically grotesque. You can't win. Whilst I personally also found their designs something I had to get used to, by the end of the movie I quite liked all the little details they added like Donnie's tech stuff, Raph's scar on his shoulder and the paint on Mikey's shell, and being able to have those wonderful expressions on their faces was a treat. The acting of the turtles MC and voice acting was pretty good overall too, but if there was more focus on them individually (character-wise) throughout the movie it'd be easier to draw a conclusion.    CONCLUSION: It's Marmite guys. You can either love the movie for what it is: an action flick with cool action about our turtles as themselves and enjoy the new interpretation in our massively varied canon. Or you can hate the designs, the villian's treatment and the familiar but unoriginal story. But in any viewpoint, it's got the privilege of not being horrendously awful OR the next blockbuster. Which way it goes on the Average Scale is up to you, but hey, at least they're not aliens.",0,0,Kazaazz,dwXFsrp6WBs,0.1299658674658674,2015-02-10 15:21:48,False,False

Just enough of a dark theme, humor and action to not make it corny. Also liked the chosen live actors. Hoag (April), Jones (Koteas), Saito. (The Shredder), Turney. (Danny), and even Serra (Chief Sterns). Didn't need BIG STARS to make a good movie A+   Teenage Mutant Ninjas Turtles 2: Secret of the Ooze (1991):  Good sequel.  Wished there was a little more action in the film but unfortunately since ppl complained about the violence in part one the director filled it full of wisecracks. Liked the attempt to do an origin story. Wish Eastman and Laird would've let the director put Bebop and Rocksteady in this movie instead of two equally dumb mutants. Could've done with Vanilla Ice's ""Ninjas Wrap"" Turbo was an ok replacement for Hoag, Reyes Jr. got a little annoying at times with his one liners...Tochi,Carl, and Faso weren't as good voicing Leonard,  Donatello, and Raph as the voice actors from the original movie. The animatronic turtles from the original were better, but these are A WORLD better than part 3.  Solid B   Teenage Mutant Ninjas Turtles 3: Lets start with the animatronic suits. They looked AWFUL. Henson studios didn't do them, so they look lie frog-turtle bad costumes. The past storyline could've worked IF they didn't make the entire thing like a feel good PG 13 , snappy snorefest.  It was a God attempt to bring back Elias Koteas, who really was in it just to be seen....but rarely used. Instead played an awful ancestor??? Overall it was the worst out of the series,  YES EVERYONE even worse than the remake.  This gets an F  TMNT (2007): I had hope for this until I had heard the AWFUL idea to split up the turtles. YES Raphael and Leonardo have butted heads but Splinter would never let this happen.  Then you don't even add a villain such as The Krang,  Leatherhead, Baxter Stockman ex.... but a millionaire and some old warrior as a villain?  Didn't like it. The only thing that was good, is the voice acting. My favorite was Mikey, voiced by Mikey Kelly.  I got a kick out of him and even though they turned Raph into a vigilante knight from hell...Noland North was a decent Raphael ans well as Taylor as Leonardo, Iwamatsu as Splinter and Evans as Casey Jones. Gellar to me...didn't sound like she fit April's tough but from attitude. .. just like Buffy doing an impersonation.  Rate this a C+  Teenage Mutant Ninjas Turtles (2014): Uhh, were do I start?  They looked hideous.. and for some reason we're only slightly taller in other versions it in this their 8 or 9 feet tall!? Then you have Bay's desperate attempt to fill this with well known actors to hopefully sell this movie.  You have horrible actress Megan Fox for sex appeal ( that's all she's good for), Will Arnett. ( who just seemed aqward and out of place) and Whoopi Goldberg -- in a flashback to 1992 as Bernadette Thompson (what? They turned Bern. Thompson from the cartoon into a black woman.  DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?) . The origin story was boring and weak, The Shredders armor was too over the top ( they got it right in part one and two bot to mention the cartoons. Is it that hard to. ... you MORONS!!!), cheap gags to cover up the plot holes, and just Michael Bay's SAD attempt to rejuvenate the franchise.

2015-11-14T19:36:40,"as a Turtles fan from way back I gotta say this movie is CRAP. I, like everyone seen the previews and thought the CGI turtles look God awful but I wanted to see for myself if i'm  just judging it unfairly so I watched it...BIG MISTAKE.    I know a lot of ppl who like this movie defend their look but they didn't look like turtles... they looked like a half human hybrid... and ugly as hell.  to the ppl who say that real turtles actually have lips,  nostrils ex... these is a fictional based turtles And in EVERY incarnation,  none of the ninja turtles  have human facial features so stop with that bullcrap.   the plot was awful.  they focused too much on April...and when they did get to the plot, the origin story was weak. the whole "" April was their pet/turtles angle"" was a desperate attempt  to connected the five characters (April and the turtles) to move the story along. You can't forget the irony of how she happens to be there when they are and how TRAINED NINJAS can't seem to stay hidden. can't forget the plot to destroy the city. ..release a deadly toxin....wait? didn't they do that in an Amazing Spider-Man or Batman Begins?  way to use new material Michael Bay...dip sh*t!!!!!  then you got the equally bad Megan Fox as April. She's so bad and unbelievable in this, you were better off putting a guy in a wig to play her.   There suppose to be basing this off the 1985 cartoon ( why else would they have Burn Thompson,  Vernon, and in the sequel Bebop & Rocksteady)...so why doesn't April have light brownish red hair? And April in a relationship with her camera man? that doesn't happen in the cartoon!!! wtf? are you making this crap up?   then you git that RIDICULOUS Shredder!  since when does he have such a complicated robotic armor that shoots blades and that has blades all over?  has that IDIOT Michael Bay seen the original cartoon?   Then there's the horrible dialogue.  Leo tells April stop following them or ""we will find you"" which was creepy enough but then Michaelangelo makes it worse by repeating the dialogue...And sounding like a psychotic stalker  and how about turning April's boss from the series into a woman?  WHAT? And on top of it you cast Whoopie Goldberg who's been irrelevant in films for two decades.  then finally these so called Ninjas (which. are trained by the best in Splinter) get their a**es kicked in most of the movie.  aren't they supposed to be well trained martial artist?  my suggestion. ...watch the 1990 film. it was fun, had just enough dark humor and some great fun lines action and fight scenes.

2015-12-27T07:21:30,"Okay I'm tired of people talking crap about Michael Bay and his movies. You do realize that Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird were there during the production of this film and they personally liked the way how Michael Bay created this movie. Plus TMNT are humanoid turtles they are not just regular turtles. They have half human blood with the their already turtle blood. So technically they look exactly how they are supposed. This isn't a cartoon like the 2007 live action animated TMNT movie starring Patrick Stewart, Sara Geller, and Chris Evans. Live action is live action with real people doing the stunts not CARTOON!!!!!!!  I don't care what anyone says the 80s got the TMNT series all wrong. For 4 reasons 1. They made the Shredder act all wimpy. Through out the whole series plus the Foot soldiers and Kraang weren't any better.   2. The only turtle that the 80's and 90's tv shows and movies have ever gotten right was Michelangelo. The average teenager/surfer accent turtle of the group and the younger sibling.   3. They made the Shredder act all wimpy. Through out the whole series plus the Foot soldiers and Kraang weren't any better. What I just wrote for number 3. They screwed their voices up. Poorly...They give Leo too deep of a voice, they made Donnie act stupid and not knowing what he was doing, and Raph way to nice than he really is.  4. Raph is suppose to be the hot-head, over protective, jerk, and rude brother of the group. With a noticeable Brooklyn Accent. Picks fights with Leo and gives him a hard time about Leo being the leader. Even though he is those things he truly cares deeply for his family and friends even though he doesn't show it 24/7. Leo is the leader, older brother, has to keep an eye on his brothers especially Mikey, tries to keep is brothers out of trouble, and mature. He has a fear of losing his family and friends. He basically has to care the weight of the world on his shoulders. Donnie is the smart, genius, tech guy, and pathetic turtle of the brother. He doesn't like violence even though he fights the Foot, Purple Dragons, and other mutants. He isn't really into that unless he has to in order to protect his family, friends, and himself.   Then the reason why Peter Laird bought the copy rights to Venus De Milo who any barely knows about is because of the 90s TV Show TMNT The Next Mutation. The whole point of the show was supposed to be about Venus and centered around this mysterious female turtle who shows up in the first episode.   Reasons why Venus De Milo doesn't show up in any of the newer TMNT Series or Movies.   1. Her whole character it's self was horribly wrong. Why?  -Kevin Eastman the original creator of Venus De Milo's character, made her personality and general make-up to be closely similar to Leonardo.  -She is supposed to be mature.  -She's a complex character and the weapons the tessens were wrong for her character. Venus should have been using these weapons the katana and bow and arrows. They are for skilled hands. Which is what she is a skilled and complex character.  -She is a shinobi and she is mediating throughout every episode. She is more intoned with spiritual side of her. Which is how she able to channel her powers.   2. The season 1 was missed up horribly. Why?  -the title is called The Next Mutation. Mean when Venus shows up in the first episode to help the turtles. The episodes following, should have been centered around her character alone. Because we already know about the turtles and splinter. But we don't know anything about Venus other than she is a shinobi.  -Venus' dad is close friends with Splinter which both of them tell the turtles. That's basically all we know plus how did Venus gain these Shinobi powers. That wasn't ever talked about at all in the season. Which is really stupid. The only things we know about Venus is that she was mutated around the same time the turtles and splinter were mutated.  -There's no background about this strange shinobi turtle. How does that work to have a great character in your hands and not make the whole seasons about her.   3. The villains.  -The villains weren't the Purple Dragons, Foot, or Shredder except for the first episode.  -The Villains were all the foes of the Female turtle Venus who knew about them and weaknesses.  -Seriously, we knew more about foes of Venus De Milo than the actual main character herself.   That's why Peter Laird stopped production of this TV series and bought the copyrights to her. Because the people who were producing this series screwed it up. They weren't following Kevin Eastman's original ideas for Venus at all.   I'm so sick and tired of reading comments about how Michael Bay screws up the Transformers movies and now how he is screwing up TMNT. The critics need to do their research and read this book called the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Ulimate History which you can find at Barnes Noble. It talks about how Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird created TMNT to begin from the Comics to the 2014 movie. It was written by them with other people helping out.   If anyone should watch TMNT and know it better from the comics it's 2003-2007 animated series of TMNT. You can type in TMNT season 1 episode 1 Things Change and it's the only TV series that comes closest to Kevin and Peter's comic book.   Now about April O Neil's character. In the earlier comics in 1984 which was the year of when the first TMNT comic can out. April originally had black and brown hair in the comics. It wasn't until sometime in the 1990s comics when you were seeing April with red or orange hair. So Michael wasn't wrong about April's character. There are different story lines through the history of the comics about April. In one Casey and April weren't together. Yes, Casey had a daughter named Shadow who Mikey ends up having a love interest in Shadow.   There is some much that no one truly knows about the comics that have to relate to movies and the tv shows. Michael Bay made the turtles correct because I said this once but I'm saying it again. It's a LIVE ACTION FILM!!!!!!! People COME ON!!!!!! Really!!!!!!! Do I really need to spell it out for you all. *rolling my eyes and facepalming* You all don't know a damn thing about TMNT comics or TV series. I mean honestly. It drives me insane to read about this every damn time the man makes a film. He does do research about these cartoon series and if you all would watch the damn bonus features about how he makes his makes his movies you will see Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird talking about their thoughts towards Michael Bay's spin on THEIR turtle creation. Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird have told everyone a million times that the Turtles are HUMANOID!!!!! Meaning they are half human with their already turtle blood.",1,2,Lone Wolf,dwXFsrp6WBs,0.04082407926082632,2015-12-27 07:21:30,False,False
