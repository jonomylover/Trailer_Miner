Don't you chauvinistic ayholes realize that WHATEVER global disaster happens, 'murica WILL NOT BE THE ONLY NATION TO REACT? So what - the world's gonna end and China, Russia, India, the European nations, south America, they will just do nothing so that 'murica can go and save democracy & bacon? I suggest you take the red, white and blue, the bald eagle, and the B-2 bomber, top it with some freedom™ and democracy™ and shove it deep deep down your yankee exhaust pipe.  P.S. My rant is not against the people of the USA, but against the chauvinistic bullcrap that the popular entertainment industry has been spewing lately, (in a pathetic attempt to boost morale and national pride, I guess), and a display that reminds me of the national-socialistic movements of the past. I am sad that so many good scenarios that could have demonstrated how humanity might come together in the face of the looming apocalypse have been turned into a steaming pile of shiet by directors and producers, who try to 'muricanise it.  P.P.S. Having in mind the current NASA budget and how they've been ""ignored"" by the US government, the sad reality for me is that probably China and India, and even Russia (even that their space program also had several shortcomings) will be able to react faster and more accurate that 'murica will. How can you people tolerate this? Have you seen that infographic in which it was calculated that if the US government spent half the amount of $ they used for waging doubtful wars around the globe for space exploration, we could have already colonized the Moon, Mars, and maybe even some of the moons of the Jovian giants? Have you seen the meme where they say that ""your phone has x times more computing power than NASA had when they send a man to the moon, and you use it to fling birds at pigs""?   I know what you might think - how can a person living in a back-end country in the middle of nowhere be so critical - he does not know jack shiet about 'murica! And you will be correct, in your own right. But I consider myself Citizen of the Earth first, and citizen of my country of origin comes after that. And as such I have been so inspired by all space-capable countries on this good Earth, I've watched with such awe that amazing machine, Saturn V, take off, or Skylab orbiting the Earth, or that very cool picture of an astronaut in his EVA, and I've always though ""wow, when I grow up, technology would allow us to explore the universe!"" - and instead what do I get - some half-developed monkeys, arguing whose weener is bigger.  People, wake up, we have a whole Universe to explore!

And God himself will be with them. And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.”  Jesus said, ""You are from the realms below; I am from the realms above. You are from this world; I am not from this world."" (John 8:23)  The earth is our home.

Nolan isn't going to touch Kubricks style with a 10 foot pole, let alone copy his themes. 2001 is about  evolution of man and the practical and philosophical problems that come with the creation of machines as powerful as hal. The only similarities interstellar will share with 2001 is the fact that they both involve humans and space travel. Also you're all focusing on Inception and the dark knight rises, i think this film is gonna be more like memento. That is if any of you Nolan band-wagoners have taken the goddamn time to see it.

They fly through a wormhole , land on a planet 1 guy dies, they only spent 1 hour on the planet but everyone else back at earth it was 23 years. They fly to another planet find a isolated insane doctor who had been sending the distress beacon out only so that someone could save him. He dies and blows up their space station. The main character saves the station somehow flies across a black hole but he and his robot AI are sucked into the black hole. Against all that makes sense he and his robot survive and they find out that a Advanced alien specied saved them. Turns out the aliens are just advanced humans from 2 million years in the future who are just seeing the past. The main character who is now 20-30 years in the future while he sees his daughter 20-30 years in the past sends her a encoded message on how to save mankind. The whole movies one big paradox and she ends up saving the humans gettibg then off earth and 100 years later while she's on her death bed her colony finely finds her fathers ship floating through space so now she's 110 and he's only 35.

But there are some unavoidable reality checkpoints: 1. Given that since the 1960s when we set men on the Moon we've progressed very slowly in that direction and as things are right now, even the near-Earth ISS is barely sustainable and we've reverted to using Soyuz rockets. At this rate, it'll not be decades or even a few generations, but hundreds of years before the idea of sending out space colonists is plausible and doable. 2. To be able to send out space colonists, they will have to be entirely self-sufficient. If something malfunctions or breaks on the long journey, there's no Hardware Store to buy a spare thruster or something. 3. And if the space colonists do get there, they will have no real capabilities to use any resources they find, if there are any, because they will have extremely limited kit with them. Summa summarum: Rapid evolution of cinematography makes for visually very compelling space stories. But the reality is going to be very slow. We are still quite a bit in the 19th and 20th centuries in many ways, the track record since the 1960s clearly shows technological progress does not automatically mean space progress, there will be a lot of failures along the way, there will be Earth-bound events like world war and other devastating events to slow or entirely cease progress down along the way, or a globally-devastating massive asteroid hit, and so on. So, we can never really know for sure if space colonisation will happen.

Yes it is epic, yes it is somewhat brainy, but when compared to his previous films it falls short. It was a case of the emotional factor greatly overpowering the coolness factor. His movies are known for the sheer brainpower it takes to fully digest them. This one tried to be as intellectual, but it definitely felt very mainstream. The cool time-paradox, black hole-traveling theme was grossly underdeveloped, and its climax downright cheesy. I was expecting them to exploit the time-traveling theme to the fullest, finding ways to move back and forth in time and through parallel universes trying to figure it all out (in typical, disorienting Nolan style) with SMALL glimpses of what was happening on Earth as a clue of whether they succeeded or not in the form of video feed, not full scenes of Earth and its melodrama. I'm not a physicist so I do not know how relevant or groundbreaking their idea of exploiting gravity as a means of time travel is, but it did not make for an exciting movie. As I said before, I'm a huge fan of Chris Nolan and his team, have seen all of his movies, but I guess after the masterpiece that Inception was, the bar was set so high it is hard to match, let alone top. When compared to most other movies out there, I'll give it a ""B+"", but when compared to other Nolan movies, it gets a solid ""C"".

The events that occurred in the film are unlikely,unconvincing and implausible. The plot results in an unexplained paradox (how did future humans first survive to make a Tesseract – given that there would have been no Tesseract to save them). Like all his movies, Nolan leaves that particular detail up for post-viewing debate. I understand that you have to watch Nolan's films w/ an open mind but INTERSTELLAR is too much of a stretch. Specially, when Cooper gets to see his daughter when she is 90 years old and he still remains in his forties.

Like all of his previous films you have to pay attention to what's going on. The end is where things get really bizarre (ie science fiction) and you don't expect it. I will watch this film again because the story makes you think (which many will find negative). I just hate all the comments by the so-called people who think they understand science-especially physics. Part of the physics in this film is based on the current testable and observable physics. Then other parts are where it's severely stretched (ie where the speculative science comes in). Nolan did his homework by choosing Kip Thorne as the scientific adviser. Believe me, you don't understand differential geometry and manifold theory like he does. But in the end, it's a science fiction movie. Is it Nolan's best? Well that's an opinion. Will I watch it again and buy it, yes-and this is a 3 hour film. The only downfall of this film is that it's NOT catering to the masses (go watch Michael Bay's Transformers X).

2014-11-11T05:47:08,"McConaughey & Hathaway starring... that's not a good start. Jessica Chastain... who? Michael Caine is pretty cool, sadly he's most likely going to have a very small part in the movie, throw a line here and there. Matt Damon, all right, this guy is cool, but he's pretty far on the list of actor, so very minor role... I like Nolan, he makes some good movies.   Now, I'll do something special. I haven't seen the movie yet, so I don't know what it is. I'm pretty sure it's going to be just like Gravity: a hyped-up movie that's actually a piece of garbage, it's just Sandra Bullock floating in space for 90 minutes... plus, the CGI on that film was terrible. Not sure why people thought it was beautiful and real, it was so easy to spot I couldn't help to find myself laughing at it a few times. Now, by something special, I meant I'm going to read the plot and see just how right or wrong my prediction is.  I have now read the plot. Goddamn it's a mess. SPOILERS beyond this point, if you care about that sort of things.    Black holes that slow down time? Yeah, no, I don't buy it. ""Extra-dimensional"" presence that opened a wormhole so humanity can escape? The hell... A ship built to house the entire human race and bring them to another planet, yet it takes them 2 years in a spacecraft to reach the worm hole? You're going to to tell me that humanity can build mother ships to transport THEIR WHOLE RACE but not a spacecraft that can go faster? When you make a sci-fi universe, you gotta make rules so it can hold itself together.  Also, from what I've read, there's arguing going on between the two main characters. Hathaway is mad because she loves Edmund and Cooper is mad because he wants to see his daughter again? You're going to tell me that these two are the trained and professional astronauts you sent on a mission to save humanity? That's the best we could do? I'm sorry, but that's just stupid.   The ending is also a little bit ridiculous, it's just sequel bait. Let's not kill the hero and send him on another mission to save the one he loves (so we can make another film)! Sometimes, it's just best to kill your hero when he has nothing left to do. Saving the whole human race? Pretty good reason to die for, nobody would be saddened by that ending.  This movie also opens itself to the biggest problem of Time Travel. A future human race created the wormhole to save humanity, but a future human race could not have created this hole if they hadn't existed in the first place. They wouldn't have existed in the first place because humanity would have died without the wormhole. This implies that a timeline switch took place. Something or someone made the timelines switch. The future human race, realizing this, would need to solve this issue - if they are even capable of it in the first place, I say this because as soon as the different timeline took place, the other would not exist. So, the future human race would need to send someone back in time, before a certain event, to open the worm hole before the end of the Earth. Does the movie explain any of this? Nope.  Then there's the NASA actually doing something? That's hilarious, but potentially the most plausible point in this entire movie. Which is sad. I'm a huge fan of science-fiction and a writer myself. On a science-fiction point, this movie is terrible. The universe Nolan made has no rules whatsoever. He doesn't explain anything about time bending and how the future human race is able to open the wormhole in the first place, because as explained above, they wouldn't exist, unless in the potential case they were about to travel back in time to open it just at the right moment. In the event Nolan hasn't made this canon in his universe, then his movie is garbage.   I don't know if the actors are good, but judging by the two stars, most likely not. I'd have to see the film in order to know how their acting are, but it's something I don't care much about films. The acting can be average or even something mediocre as long as there is plot. A good plot with rules to its universe, that's what I expect out of a science-fiction movie. Emotions are just distracting most of the time.  Even funnier, I continued down the article to see they hired a ""scientific consultant"", a certain Kip Thorne. I'm not sure who this guy is, maybe he's good at science, but he certainly isn't good at science-fiction. I quote the article here: ""Thorne laid down a couple of guidelines; that nothing would violate established physical laws, and that all the wild speculations would spring from science and not from the fertile mind of a screenwriter"". As I said, this scientific guy has no clue how to make science-fiction. The goal of science-fiction is push the boundaries of what we consider to be true. This man is effectively holding back humanity by being so conservative about what we think is reality, because it isn't. 100 years ago, going to space was pure science-fiction, now we set foot on the moon and we have a space station orbiting the planet. Men like this Thorne had nothing to do with this accomplishment. The men who accomplished this were visionaries and dreamers, not people stuck in the past.  He based all the visuals off ""Einstein's general relativity"" equations. While Einstein was a genius, he's outdated. These equations were made in 1916, nearly 100 years ago. That's old. Technology has come so far since then. We have computers, for one. Imagine what Einstein would have been able to do with computers! I didn't know him, but I'm fairly sure he would say the same thing. True men and women of science want progress. You don't keep old things and say it's the only way. Hell, scientists still believe in Newton's law and it was made in the 1660s... we're a little bit far from progress now, are we?  Will I go see this movie? Sure, why not. Someone in my family wanted to see it and they don't think too much when it comes to science and science-fiction, so they'll probably have a good time. I most likely won't find too much to like, but it's not unusual when it comes to movies these days. There's a trend about ""more emotions, less plot"" currently, and it's boring. I wish they'd stop that and bring the plot back. Give me Star Trek again, the original Star Trek, not the reboot (while the reboot is an average action film, it's far from the original which had plot and rules to its universe. The second movie of the reboot had Khan teleporting from Earth to Qo'nos, really?). Or you know, anything with a plot would be good...  Please do forgive any spelling mistakes I may have made. It's the middle of the night, but I couldn't let such a terrible movie get away with the praise its getting right now...

2014-11-14T11:06:06,"   WARNING FULL PLOT         In the future, Earth's natural resources have become so scarce that humankind has regressed to an agrarian society on the verge of failure. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former NASA test pilot-turned-farmer, lives with father-in-law, son, and his ten-year-old daughter Murphy (Mackenzie Foy). Murphy believes her room is haunted by a poltergeist trying to communicate with her. She and Cooper discover the ""ghost"" is an unknown intelligence sending coded messages through gravitational waves, revealing binary coordinates in the dust that direct them to a secret NASA installation led by Professor Brand (Michael Caine).  Brand reveals that a wormhole, apparently created for humanity by an alien intelligence, offers a chance for survival on a new planet. Through the wormhole, NASA's ""Lazarus missions"" have identified three potentially habitable planets orbiting the black hole Gargantua: Miller, Edmunds, and Mann, named after the astronauts who surveyed them. Brand recruits Cooper to pilot the experimental spacecraft Endurance to recover the astronauts' data; once one of the planets is determined habitable, humanity will follow aboard space stations. On the mission, Cooper joins Brand's daughter, biologist Amelia (Anne Hathaway); physicist Romilly (David Gyasi); geographer Doyle (Wes Bentley); and two artificially intelligent robots, TARS (voiced by Bill Irwin) and CASE (voiced by Josh Stewart). Cooper's decision to join Endurance breaks Murphy's heart, and they part on bad terms.  Endurance enters the wormhole and heads to Miller, but they discover the planet is so close to Gargantua that the gravitational pull causes severe time dilation: each hour on the surface is seven years on Earth. Cooper, Amelia, Doyle and CASE descend to the planet, which proves inhospitable as it is completely covered by a shallow ocean roiled by enormous tidal waves. As Amelia attempts to recover Miller's data, a wave hits, killing Doyle and delaying the shuttle's departure. When they return to the Endurance, 23 years have passed there.  On Earth, the adult Murphy (Jessica Chastain) is now a NASA scientist attempting to solve a physics problem that has troubled Brand for years: how the gigantic space stations, too heavy to launch with conventional rockets, could be lifted via gravity. The dying Brand admits he already solved the problem and determined that the project is impossible without additional data from a black hole's singularity. Concluding that humanity cannot escape Earth, Brand instead put his faith in a ""population bomb"", which will use fertilized eggs to start humanity anew, sacrificing Earth's population.  Now low on resources, Endurance can only visit one more planet before returning to Earth. Amelia believes Edmunds' planet has more promising data, but Cooper and Romilly favor Mann's planet, as Mann is still transmitting. Cooper accuses Amelia of letting her emotional attachment to Edmunds cloud her judgment, while Amelia argues both planets could be explored if Cooper would give up on returning to Earth. The team votes for Mann. When they land, they find an icy, inhospitable world where Mann (Matt Damon) is still alive; he forged data about his planet's viability so that Endurance would rescue him. Mann reveals that the plan to send humanity to one of the planets was a lie and that the real plan is to use the fertilized eggs to continue the species, sacrificing humanity on Earth. When Cooper wants to return to Earth, Mann breaks Cooper's spacesuit visor and leaves him to die, and Romilly dies when he accidentally triggers a bomb Mann set to protect his secret. Mann flees to Endurance on a shuttle, intending to proceed with the ""population bomb"" project on Edmunds' world. Amelia rescues Cooper on the other shuttle and they arrive at Endurance in time to witness Mann docking improperly. The airlock depressurizes, killing Mann and causing serious damage, but Cooper uses the shuttle to get the Endurance under control.  With little fuel remaining, Cooper and Amelia plan to slingshot Endurance around Gargantua on a course to Edmunds. TARS and Cooper detach into the black hole, hoping to collect data on the singularity and propel Endurance by dropping mass. Cooper and TARS emerge in an extra-dimensional ""tesseract"" where time appears as a spatial dimension and portals lead to Murphy's childhood bedroom at various times. Cooper realizes the extra-dimensional beings are future humans, and have created this space so he can communicate with Murphy as the ""ghost"" from her childhood and save humanity. Using gravitational waves, Cooper transmits TARS' data on the singularity to the adult Murphy through Morse code, allowing her to complete Brand's equation and evacuate Earth. Years later, Cooper awakes aboard a NASA space station and reunites with the now-elderly Murphy. On her deathbed, she convinces Cooper to search for Amelia, who is alone on Edmunds' planet.",0,0,Mitchel Mattera,0vxOhd4qlnA,-0.023808372478585242,2014-11-14 11:06:06,False,True

Nolan likes to explain a lot the syntax of the plot and that's why this movie lowers a bit his high scale ambitions and helps to realize possible plot holes although I found the premise fascinating... but he also gives the images power and his own dynamism in a whole new level for him. and just that the images make your mind fly... that's truly something. not perfect but I think this is a truly good movie and one of those that deserves multiple views.",0,0,prawstation,0vxOhd4qlnA,0.20284632034632036,2014-11-25 15:53:15,False,True

And no real explanation of if this was in the future or present day (i understand its just a movie but a lil more background would have helped ppl understand whats going on) so with that being said, the movie just felt like it was pushing itself along to get to the climax and the end in a hurry. Again, not a bad movie at all, just fell very short of expectations for me anyway. I would give it a 6 out of 10 rating.

This movie is bad, really bad.  Boring, confusing, a meaningless mass of illogical muddled dialogue from McConaughey and others. The HAL 9000 tech helper is a machine called TARS.  It’s a walking talking oversized Kit-Kat.  Even more bizarre is the Matt Damon surprise cameo. He’s out of place but briefly creates the only real drama in the story.  A story that is attempting to tackle such a haughty premise about how humanity might someday migrate to distance planets doesn’t need “A” list actors to pull this off.  The premise and effects are the stars. Could you imagine 2001: A Space Odyssey with Rock Hudson? The story stumbles along painfully. Every so often McConaughey reminds us the end of the world is coming if they don’t succeed.  So, what is happening on the earth?  Not much really, dust storms.  And why do they need to find alternate worlds to save the Earth?  Not sure really, probably the answer was on the blackboard with those equations they kept brooding over.  Watch this, and it will blow your mind.  THIS is what a film like Interstellar promised to deliver to an audience and failed miserably!! http://sploid.gizmodo.com/the-most-extraordinary-and-inspiring-vision-of-the-futu-1664783812?utm_campaign=socialflow_gizmodo_facebook&utm_source=gizmodo_facebook&utm_medium=socialflow I love to sail forbidden seas.",0,2,emanmark,0vxOhd4qlnA,-0.11666666666666665,2014-12-01 04:56:38,False,True

2014-12-13T15:08:19,"  So, I found some youtube comments about #interstellar  i could really relate to and I really liked. Here they are: (take your time)  ABOUT THE MOVIE ITSELF:  A masterpiece. Both, the film and the soundtrack. I was blown away and still think about this film regularly. It is an outstanding experience and ambitious. I hope this film will pass the test of time like 2001 did. It deserves it. Not many movies make me speechless after the credits roll. This film did. I could not talk for minutes because I was so impressed and deeply moved by the past 3 hours, especially the last 30 minutes. I will never understand the hate Nolan and this movie gets. For me, this is the best film in 2014, heck, one of the best sci fi films ever made.﻿  Just watching the trailer touched me in a way that no movie has. This is a film i've been waiting for all my life, call me a nerd.   This movie is incredible. Anyone who says this movie is bad, that is your opinion. Your opinion is wrong.﻿  This movie takes film back to when the story was told with special effects and not the other way around. It has such a classical feel to it, being down to earth with the use of special effects to not enhance the experience in any way but to show it like how it would really possibly be like to travel to these places. Not to say the special effects weren't AMAZING, but they didn't overwhelm the story telling part of the movie. Simple story packed with circumstantial emotions and thought provoking.  I just saw this movie today. I must say, I would not be brave enough to take a glimpse inside of Christopher Nolan's mind. There are good movies, and then there are great movies. And then there is Interstellar. I have no words.﻿  Saw this yesterday and was blown away by it. I will never understand the absolute hate that Nolan gets. Is it because he is an ""event"" filmmaker now? Some people get pissed on as soon as they reach this amount of success. Anyways, the movie was fantastic and really brought out the wonder that space travel can inspire. Another great Matty Mac performance as well. And to those reviews from all the critics saying that the movie is ""too ambitious""...EAT IT. Movies SHOULD be this ambitious.  And this soundtrack was absolutely haunting. Can't wait to watch it again. ﻿  How many movies out there have tried to examine and explain the wormhole effect with such cgi as this, show planetary issues in gravity and other possible time phenomena? Let alone a MASSive wave as high as Mt Everest?﻿    The best movie that has ever been made. Perfect scenery, great actors, no overacting and over the top action scenes, perfect music and just a great story with no gaps and question marks. The first movie I watched twice in cinema and I will go a third time, because it's so powerful there. Watch with as few people as possible and don't talk, just watch and go inside your own thoughts. Just wow!  Just saw this movie and all I can say is it is .... amazing! The musical score probably the best I've ever heard. I loved the plot and how they blended science and the plot together better than any other movie given the subject (interstellar travel, time, relativity, etc), and I honestly would put Anne Hathaway up for some kind of Oscar for her part.  And yes, we as a species need to become a space-faring species not for adventure or exploration but as Carl Sagan said, ""for the most practical reason imaginable - staying alive.""﻿  ABOUT THE AMAZING SOUNDTRACK:  When watching this movie, there was one very interesting parallel I made regarding the soundtrack and the plot of the movie. Hans decided to use a church organ (twisted with effects of course), and I think it’s genius. Humans are afraid of the unknown, powers that we cannot describe – be it space, nature, ghosts or even God - which is what this movie is about. I’ve always had that creeping feeling while visiting churches, becomes of God and Satan and all that surrounds these two, because it is unknown to me. I affiliate a church organ to the fear but also fascination of the unknown powers in our lives because of this, and I don’t think I’m alone. Hearing the church organ during this movie directly got me into that feeling, which is what the movie is much about. Fear and fascination of the unknown. A genius move, by a genius man, Hans Zimmer. But he takes it one step further. Notice how the organ in most cases only participate in uplifting or semi-uplifting melodies/progressions. Why? It gives the perception that these unknown powers of our world does not necessarily have to be evil or intimidating as many of us assume, which is exactly what happens in the movie. This, inspires me incredibly much as an aspiring composer myself. The thought that goes into making a soundtrack for a movie so full of thoughts.  Its weird because with some of the soundtrack, u can just totally feel the time ticking away...﻿  Before I started this I tried to see if someone put in a time so I can skip to the good parts but I couldn't find a single comment with one. Made me very optimistic about this and It I ended up listening to the whole 1 hour soundtrack. Oh Hans.﻿  I watched this film a few weeks ago while blazing on mandy. It was literally the most intense thing i have ever seen, i genuinley got nervous as hell when it looked like Cooper wasnt gonna make it in some of the scenes.

(Like the Astral, Causal, Mental, and Etheric planes for example)  Also because of regression therapy (reference Dr. Brian Weiss, Dr. Michael Newton, and Dr. Bruce Goldberg), I believe in Spirit Guides, Ascended Masters - and the like! - who we can potentially tune into making contact with, even if just on a subtle energy level",0,0,Cory Prior,0vxOhd4qlnA,0.08229166666666667,2015-01-04 08:55:00,False,True

I enjoyed his earlier films, though have never been inspired to see them again. The Dark Knight trilogy went from good to great to good again, but none of them have inspired me to view the film beyond the first time, save for TDK which I watched twice. Inception was visually arresting and at the time was an amazing experience, but the more I thought about the film afterwards the less excited I was. I guess that is the thing. His films ask the viewers to think, and because we do there are going to be people that think themselves out of liking them.  As for Interstellar, I am not sure why people were getting so darn emotional over the previous trailers. They did nothing for me at all. This was better, but still seems to be trying to push that desired image of ’2001 for post-millennial times’. I am not sure that it will be able to reach those heights.

2015-01-31T23:22:58,"  Saw this movie last night. Been waiting months to see it. The beginning sinks its hooks in the problem is once the movie gets going it flies off track very quick. The CGI is all weak as hell. Every planet they go to has no unique features... they all look like Earth (except for a big wave.. woopy) and they don't even try to color the landscapes or anything. The ""robots"" are literally cardboard boxes painted with silver spray paint. I think we could have portrayed more realistic robots in the 1940's. Then the ending is like Nolan put a bunch of scripts on a roulette table and randomly picked them 1 by 1. ""Ok, lets have McConaughey eject from the spaceship and pretend to die"". ""Now, lets make him drift into space like he's dying.. just like Sandra Bullock in Gravity"". ""Great, now... lets make him randomly find a >>>ROOM"" ... yes a ROOM (called a ""Tesseract"") in the middle of BUMBLEFUCK NOWHERE SPACE that has 0 explanation for being there but winds up saving his life at which point he somehow miraculously wakes up in Saturn.. meets his very ugly 'daughter'  (who drives to Saturn in 2 weeks when it took him >>>months of hibernating to get there from Earth) she in no way resembles her younger self ... they hug and that'll be our shitty masterpiece ending! It was just literally absurd. What they SHOULD have done is #1, put make up on the 2nd Murph to make her look older. Cause the replacement ""old Murph"" looked NOTHING... NOT EVEN CLOSE to the 2nd. They really needed better acting. Like when the young girl threw the watch than pouted I thought ""that was the most poorly acted scene ever"". Then the god awful ""tidal waves"" that are like 1 mile high but then you realize ""OMG! THEY ARE >>STANDING IN 1-2 FT OF WATER?!!! WTF?"". So many parts like this that you can't just ignore. Then that Tesseract that Matthew coincidentally ejects into.... I understand time lines / different dimensions but WHAT THE FUCK are his chances of ejecting from a seat and winding up in some trippy time war 5 dimension tesseract? I understand sci-fi like this isn't suppose to make sense. Relativity and all that shit. But the movie just lost it's mind and got cheesy as hell at the end. HOW did future humans even survive to make the Tesseract in the first place? Given that there'd be NO Tesseract to save them? Nevermind. I'll just put it like this. If you're a kid or younger person, you'll probably like it. If you're an adult you will probably hate the second half. Unless you're retarded and like cheesy movies. They copied the same shit Gravity did with the dramatic space ship mounting scenes. ""OMG... we will all die if we can't mount this spaceship!!"". You know the second it's said Coopers gonna save humanity for the 40th time and you're gonna have to watch 5 minutes of spaceshuttle intercourse with cheesy dramatic violins in the back.

Even the music was disappointing. I appreciate Nolan telling Zimmer not to use his trademark drums and strings because it had been copied so much, but this film really needed that epic soundtrack to take some of the weight of the weak script.

However, I think Nolan bit off more than he could chew with this one. After viewing, I kept thinking this film was over indulgent in nearly every way. The characters were weak, plot rushed (terrible flow), overly melodramatic, and ultimately disappointing in its scope. What he lacked in those key areas he tried to make up with state of the art special effects and a suffocation of scientific information (there's nothing wrong with that in general but it's just foolish to try and cram that level of cosmology and quantum physics education into a 3 hour mainstream movie). To me, Nolan is like the Starbucks of film making; on the surface his style and choice of themes seem intellectual and authentic. However, under that surface is just a watered down, massed produced corporate product under the guise of quality. I don't think this is a masterpiece in the same way ""2001"" or ""Alien"" were.

Brand has to prove Cooper wrong about the expedition being _a long-shot_ with a condescending smile. The nurse has to laugh incredulously when Cooper assumes Cooper station was named after him. Do we have to have this laboured _women are great too!_ subtext?  The NASA aspect was intriguing, especially the _moon landing was not a hoax_ part; was this movie a bit of a NASA PR campaign?

2015-04-18T18:00:18,"*Warning: Spoiler Alert*  I've noticed that no one on the internet in any article or video is able to explain the ending of Interstellar completely. I am going to explain it to you in the most simple and straight-forward words.  I'm assuming you have already watched the movie and understand everything in the start (which was pretty straight-forward).  Plan A was to ship the entirety of humanity in ships but Dr. Brand hadn't finished the equation which would allow them to lift such heavy ships off the ground. There was missing information about gravity. Dr. Brand however promised Cooper he will have finished the equation once Cooper returns after finding a habitable planet.  Plan B was to take human embryos along with them on the journey so they can continue the human species.  Dr. Brand knew all along that Plan A was impossible because the missing information of gravity could not be obtained with their abilities.  Everything that happened in the movie happened. They went through the wormhole and visited Miller's planet and Mann's planet. They ran out of fuel and Cooper rescued Endurance. Cooper sacrificed himself because he knew there was no way he would make it back to Earth anyways so he sacrificed himself so Emilia could be saved along with the human embryos. Cooper DIES. Emilia makes it to Edmunds' planet and everyone on Earth DIES because Plan A was not possible. Emilia continues to raise the embryos and the human species continue on Edmunds. The embryo population know that Cooper was their savior. Millions of years later, the human species on Edmunds evolve into the higher dimension and become fifth dimensional human beings. Now time is for them just like space is for us. They can freely move around any TIME. They are not bound by anything. They have access to infinite amount of TIME. They even have access to moments millions of years ago.   They know that Cooper died for them and never got to meet his daughter. However, now that they have access to infinite amounts of time, they can manipulate time. They cannot directly communicate with the third dimensional human beings in the moments they have access to and cannot give them the secret information of gravity (as now they have infinite access to time and space they know the secret info). However, they know through the use of gravitational anomalies they can somehow get Cooper to find the secret information. To pay a tribute to their savior they manipulate space and TIME because of their abilities to build a wormhole that leads to a planet NEAR a black hole. Why a black hole? Because a black hole has that missing gravity information.  The movie starts from here when THEY manipulate space and time in order for the past to play out differently. Everything happens and this time Cooper sacrifices himself and was going to DIE again but the future human beings manipulate time and space for him and save him and get him into the tesseract (which is fifth dimensional space and that is why Cooper has access to infinite time and can manipulate the moments he sees through gravity) in order to communicate the missing information to his DAUGHTER (her ghost) so that the people of Earth could be saved. This is what happens and after he communicates it to her, the fifth dimensional human beings close the tesseract and send Cooper back through the wormhole (which is also fifth dimensional space which is why he shakes Emilia's hand). Now Cooper and his daughter have saved the world and they meet. The fifth dimensional human beings have paid their tribute to their savior through their capabilities of space and time.  This is what the story of Interstellar is trying to communicate to us.  We live in a world where we cannot manipulate space and time and can only move forward. But THEY are who have evolved into fifth dimensional human beings. The past, the present, the future does not exist. Everything exists simultaneously.  I hope everyone understood what I said.

2015-05-24T15:52:43,"OK. I have a theory.   *SPOILER ALERT !!* Anyone who hasn't watched Interstellar do *NOT* click Read More.          OK. There was two things that I never understood about the ending of Interstellar.   *1:* Micheal Caines character says in the beginning of the film; ""We have to face the fact that nothing in our Solar System can save us"" Yet at the end of the film they have left Earth and went to a Moon orbiting Neptune, which is in our Solar System. I understand that Cooper used Morse code to send the solution of the ""Gravity Equation to Murph, who solved it, but I don't see how that makes any difference to the place of the Moon of Neptune. ( Cooper Station, Named after Murph ) I mean, if they solved Gravity, which has such a strong hold as to warp Time and Light surely they would find the missing link in the ""Time Equation"" or even the ""Light Equation"", and if they solved any of these equations surely they would be capable of traveling further distances from our Solar System to look for life and would have the capable resources to travel back without using a Wormhole like Cooper and the Endurance Ship did. I'm not scientist so this point could be gibberish to a Astronomers mind, but I think it is a plausible thought.  *2:* When Cooper found Murph in hospital at the end of the film she says that ""No father should watch their children die"" which got me thinking ; Did Cooper forget that he had a son, and that his son was dead? He never even mentioned him, nor did the doctors. They only mentioned Murph. I understand that they must adore Murph because she solved the equation and saved the population of our planet but, surely Cooper loved both his children equally and would also notice that his son is no longer alive. Maybe he just didn't want to face the thought of his sons death, but surely he could've at least visited his son's grave before going to Anne Hathaway's planet. ( Sorry, forgot her characters name. ) Or maybe Coopers son stayed on Earth. And died there, I think they should've mentioned it. I had a feeling that the producers just wanted to get the ending over as quick as possible.  *My Theory:*  I have a theory of my own concerning ""Life On Other Planets"" and ""What Is Out There"" My theory is that *WE* are out there ... *WE* are God ... *WE* are the Aliens ... Let me get specific ...  I believe that in the future we will have evolved beyond the laws of Time, Space, and Gravity. This is in the far distant future. If we do, and this is just a theory, we would be capable of traveling through Space and Time. Henceforth, sending signals to Earth from the future. The birth of Jesus, for example, people claim they say a *Bright Star* in the sky before Jesus was born. What if this was a Spaceship sent by us from the future? I mean, according to the Bible Jesus was sent by God / Us from the future to save the people of Earth. What if Jesus was an Alien who could preform all these ""Miracles"" because his Evolutionary status allowed him too? He knew what was going to happen. He knew he was going to die. That's because he was from the future. I know this contradicts The Bible on that Jesus was born of Mary but let me ask you this. How was Mary conceived? No one impregnated her. In the Bible it says an Angel / Alien / Us from the future came to her and told her she would become the mother of God ... The mother of our savior ... The mother of a divine King ...  God could be a signal sent away before our time to us in the future.

For me this was a beautiful love story about a Dad and his children, as they were portrayed in the beginning of the movie.

I love all space and SI-FI movies, so when I heard stuff like ""incredible"", ""amazing"", ""epic"", ""masterpiece"", ""one of the greatest movies ever made"", I was stoked for this.  And then I watched the movie.  The special effects were impressive.  The plot and storyline?  Not so much.  Actually, it borders on mind-numbingly stupid towards the end.  So he basically drops into a black hole, ejects out of his craft, turns into Paul Rudd's side-kick partner from Ant-Man, and goes back in time to the day he left.  Here are some questions -   Why would his message to Murph be ""Stay"", in trying to get Murph to convince her dad to stay?  If that happens, and he doesn't leave in the first place on this mission, it's the end of mankind, as Murph would never receive the data regarding gravitational pull.  How in the world did Cooper take the data from the robot, and transfer the info into the second hand on the watch?   Not directly, but how was he able to manipulate the watch itself, to make the second hand tap backwards, using Morse Code?  How exactly is someone rescued from floating in space after going through a black hole with no ship?  I guess oxygen isn't needed in space once you enter a black hole?  And then we have Dr. Brand.  After Cooper takes his ship into the black hole, Dr. Brand is left with a severly damaged ship, limited fuel, and remember, she's not a pilot, she's a scientist, but still somehow gets the ship to the final planet.  All in all, the movie was pretty to look at, but poorly thought out.  The concept could have work, if they decided to cover their bases and explain things.

2016-02-14T08:41:37,"I will say, after seeing this movie countless times I have finally realized something that was a huge take in the movie. Of course it is my personal opinion. Love. The debate between the explorers was made on evidence and which is more relevant. And they introduce love as a force that can be materialized into human concept, and be used as plausible evidence for their decision. But I personally believe that it is not measurable, but is still just as reasonable as any other data. In our day in age you cannot measure love. You can only picture it. But for her, despite her being resilient to any ideas she does not agree with, she believes love is a huge factor in the decision. Just like any data collected from observations a person makes, the decision to believe in the results is fully up to the holder of information. After collecting ""data"" from her relationship with her lover, she can put her trust in her decision. But data collected from a human to human interaction is not as solid as a human to an object. The factor of unstabability is far too great. But if put into measurements, it can be far greater then any findings made in our time. The question then would be how much are you willing to trust someone elses data they have collected personally. Only those you can understand this reasoning and have experienced it will understand and make the truly educated choice.

For if every movie had a trailer this mesmerizing and Epic then it would take away from the truly great films of our time. despite what critics have said about this film and what many others have said about this film, how it was boring or how it was too long , that is their opinion and I respect their opinion. But when I saw this movie I did not see your boring movie and I did not see a movie that was too long because how does one judge something that is too long? if this movie had been 8 hours long I would have watched it and enjoyed it and no I am not a film critic but I do love watching movies and this movie, yes I love watching it. Jessica Chastain and Matthew McConaughey were fantastic in this film and I believe this film deserves more credit then it has already received. But that's just my opinion which means nothing in the grand scheme of things. all I'm trying to say is this movie is an amazing film and it is the reason we go to the movies to watch them",0,0,Hector Texidor,0vxOhd4qlnA,0.21052631578947367,2016-04-28 16:03:58,False,False

The difference is that the obstacle is one that effects us all, it is time. Our gift and our curse from the moment we are born. That's what makes a film so fictitious seem so real and relatable.

Just think about your life and see what have you done till this moment. Are you a slave to the society and ""culture"", or are you actually doing something awesome? This could be something, we could be someone. Humankind can be something; otherwise we'll destroy ourselves and our little planet and since there's no wormhole waiting somewhere, we would be extincted, simple as that. That's why this movie can make us all (including me) cry, because we know we can be something, though it seems distant and impossible at times.

One thing though that I continue to see in almost every trailer is the destruction of entire segments of the movie's surprise factor seemingly without the trailer editor's awareness. I just remember the entire part of the movie leading up to the investigation of the water planet seemed a bit silly as a viewer given I knew exactly what would result. Now given it was known there were more potential planets as a viewer I could assume the first planet would be trash since that would question why the other planets were mentioned at all, but thats what I want in movies, to not be able to know what's going to happen at all. Again, one of if not my favorite movie, which is likely why its few flaws seem so important.

This movie deserved a lot more admiration and love, but  couldn't get it because most of the people's brain got hay wired by nolan's  5th dimensional logic and theory. They really couldn't understand the significance of this movie. Otherwise this movie would have entered in 2 Billions earnings group. Interstellar is love. Thank you sir christopher nolan <3 And also thanks stephen hawking for mentoring nolan .

2018-10-11T05:46:01,"Mass and weight are two entirely different aspects.   There is a basic  **difference** , because  **mass**  is the actual amount of material contained in a body and is measured in kg, gm, etc. Whereas  **weight**  is the force exerted by the gravity on that object mg. Note that  **mass**  is independent of everything but  **weight**  is different on the earth, moon, etc  A dream has neither weight nor mass, mass in the sense of the an object in a dream having weight in a gravitational environment, but is comprised of objects that are seen visually that have weight and mass.  According to physics nothing can exist without mass which then converts into weight in a gravitational environment.   But there the dream is, existing with mass but no no mass at all, nor does the dream not have any mass or weight itself.   Therefore a dream can exist in a state of mass and weight not being present. A dream can also exist prior to the Big Bang that formed the Big Bang based on what life needed to exist outside of the dream in a state where mass and weight are necessary for the mass less and weight to exist.  A dream - Has mass, but mass that does not have any weight too it even though the person dreaming has mass and weight where both are in a gravitational environment. Therefore a dream is both mass and massless at exactly the same time.   Mass that is based on the eyes taking in light that is reflected from an object to re create the object with mass in the dream that is mass less because it does not have any weight in a gravitational environment.

Abrams' Star Trek's Iowa intros were fucking awesome) if the earth scenes are boring then the film should be about escaping the humdrum life on earth. Or tatooine, etc.. Matt, Anne, crew are talking about the mission like they haven't even prepped. (You ready to leave the solar system? You mean galaxy?) everything is rehearsed in space missions. By the book. Armstrong's ""one small step"" was rehearsed to make the moment epic, and hell yes it was, but I'm sure a second later they went back to shop talk. Lol. When you write a movie you have the luxury of being able to compress time, flash forward. This movie felt very first draft. The fact that money was spent *cringe* on the CGI to create a water scene so they could say ""those aren't mountains. They're waves."" is so regrettable. First, that's a lame riff on Obi Wan's ""that's no moon"". Second, so like they didn't know the planet's mass or anything. Gravity was earth-like. What was that ocean made of? To the people who praised this movie I'm like, are you a paid spokesperson or have you never seen good sci fi? Or mediocre sci fi? The Martian had a decent premise. ""Life"" with Ryan Reynolds had suspense. Life and the Martian weren't great. But compared to Intersteller...not that bad. In conclusion, Interstellar was real bad.
