He hates God, feels guilty and only seeks revenge of the man that killed his child and that need for  revenge is tearing him apart. God tells him to come back to the cabin in the note in his mail box. He does not know that this was God. The three people at the cabin represents God, Jesus and Mary. He is brought back to the cabin because it was where he felt the most empty of Gods love. It was where his Darkest hour was.  But it was in his darkest hour that the angels camped around him even though he did not know it. They were even present when his child died. The woman that represents Mary encourages him to forgive not for the killer, but for his own sake. The blooming garden represents Gods ability to work miracles where none should be present.First time I saw the trailer it was clear as a bell.",0,3,rosey312,waTEbgLYG-g,0.08571428571428573,2016-12-02 20:32:41,True,True

2016-12-03T18:28:40,"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ SPOILER WARNING ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Christians don't like this film  now that may not be a surprise to anyone familiar with 'The Shack', but for those who aren't: the reason Christians reject this story is because the nice black lady 'Elousia', the middle-eastern man, and the asian woman 'Sarayu' are representations of the three persons of the Holy Trinity - God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit, respectively  of course some people reading this might say; ""i'm a christian, i think the shack is a beautiful interpretation of whom God is and how God wants us to live"" but i'm afraid they aren't really christians - because anyone who relies on this story to help them understand God, is rejecting the words of Scripture where God constantly refers to Himself in masculine pronouns and reveals Himself as Father  Jesus himself is recorded as speaking of both God the Father and God the Holy Spirit with masculine pronouns  perhaps you don't think this is a big deal, but God also reveals Himself in scripture as being very particular about how mankind represents Him - and we get the word 'Blasphemy' from the idea of giving a witness account in a court of law; and if one gives a false testimony in court, they are 'speaking evil' or 'blaspheming'  and since God goes out of His way in Scripture to refer to Himself in masculine terms, then to represent Him in any other way is a misrepresentation, a false account, or a 'blasphemy'  so bearing in mind that the underlying premise to this whole story is a misrepresentation of whom God is, we then have to ask if the lessons this story teaches 'also' misrepresent what God demands of mankind?  the consensus of real christians is that yes, it does - and anyone who embraces the false god represented in The Shack is still on their way to Hell",0,9,Christy O'Faghan,waTEbgLYG-g,0.007765151515151496,2016-12-03 18:28:40,True,True

People often lose children, parents, siblings, spouses in horrible ways.

Years ago, the book was extremely controversial in the Christian world - in fact friends and fellowships split harshly over it. Most of the haters couldn't get over a black woman representing a big part of God's nature and wisdom - they considered it 100% heresy - and many could not bear to finish reading the short book. But what I took from the book was totally different. The book dealt squarely with an ""all too often"" theme that the church is unable to successfully confront - and that is how is it possible to find/keep/return to ""faith"" in the midst of a terrible human tragedy (of the worst kind). This book takes on an event that would shatter the strongest faith, the kind of event that will always force the question ""how a good God could possibly exist in such a mean, disgusting, terrible world.""

Because Christ lived a perfect life we CAN NEVER LIVE, and Christ took our punishment of  SHAME, Guilt, and SIN on the Cross He suffered the death we deserve to suffer so that we will not go to HELL when we die. He took the wrath of our Father for our SIN and rebellion against HIM(GOD). the Christ defeated the GRAVE so that all who REPENT AND TRUST IN CHRIST ALONE TO BE FORGIVEN well go to Heaven (paradise) to live, love, enjoy, be with God forever.  I'm sorry my dear friend that you have a faulty worldview of Christianity. please read Hebrews in the BIBLE(GODS HOLY WORD) and learn about our great and merciful savior God Jesus the CHRIS the one and only true GOD of the universe.",0,0,nothinggoodinme,waTEbgLYG-g,0.20139860139860144,2016-12-11 02:29:10,True,True

Life doesn't, has never, and will never work that way. Faith, logic, spirituality, religion, whatever one personally holds to in order to get through the joys and pains of life is a common thread that all humans share. THAT is what could make this movie truly uplifting, rather than so much schlock designed to appease a target audience. I have no problem with a movie that might have a certain take on religion or spirituality. For example ""What Dreams May Come"". I'm not enough of a cinephile to give other international examples, though I'm sure there are many. Those perspectives are fine.  Just like any movie, it's how the story is told.

The author explained in the beginning that it was fictional and he wrote it for his kids. Maybe it's not 100% biblical but neither was the work of CS Lewis and there's not a church out there that would argue Lewis' imagination and say he wasn't biblical. Lewis said the Gospel didn't make sense to him until he used his imagination.

2017-03-01T13:28:28,"Young’s stereotypical characterization of the Father as a “large beaming African-American woman,” the Son as a Jew with a large nose, and the Holy Spirit as a mysterious Asian female makes me more than a little queasy. Furthermore, virtually every theological heresy begins with a misconception of the nature of God. The Shack is no exception. After chiding those he believes to have misconceptions about the Trinity, Young proceeds to compromise, confuse, or outright contradict biblical orthodoxy. He pictures the Father bearing crucifixion scars as well as being incarnated in tandem with the Holy Spirit. In historic, biblical Christianity only the Son is incarnated and only the Son suffers and dies on the cross. Moreover, Young pontificates that Jesus “has never drawn upon his nature as God to do anything” (emphasis in original). Those who have read through the Bible will immediately recognize the falsity of this statement—particularly with respect to the resurrection. For example, in John’s Gospel Jesus says, “The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down my life—only to take it up again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This command I received from my Father” (John 10:17–18 NIV). Equally problematic is the fact that Young negates the notion of functional subordination within the Godhead. As the large beaming African-American woman in Young’s novel explains, the Trinity is “in a circle of relationship, not a chain of Command.…Hierarchy would make no sense among us” (emphasis in original). In biblical orthodoxy, however, the incarnate Christ says, “I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself; He can do only what He sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does” (John 5:19 NIV). Put another way, functional hierarchy is not antithetical to ontological equality. Finally, Young has Jesus—the Jew with the big nose—declaring, “I’m not a Christian” and “I have no desire to make them [Buddhists, Mormons, Muslims, etc.) Christian.” Indeed, Young describes Christians as religious fanatics and part of a sinful world system. In sharp distinction, the followers of Christ adopted the word “Christian” in the midst of suffering and persecution. The apostle Peter, for example, writes, “If you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed but praise God that you bear that name” (1 Pet. 4:16 NIV; cf. Acts 11:26). The fact that The Shack is being touted by those who take the sacred name of Christ upon their lips is a sad commentary on Christian discernment. As has been well said, “If you haven’t read The Shack, don’t.” —Hank Hanegraaff Hank Hanegraaff is host of the Bible Answer Man broadcast heard daily throughout the United States and Canada.

The book ended with him telling police about where his daughter was and they went to the cave and found her. also found the killer and other little girls that had been killed. Movie left that out. Read the book. Some people have dreams when in comas and some dream while asleep. You who are non-believers need to open your eyes and read history.

I'm sorry but if one of his kids was about to murder his little daughter then he would have no problem deciding to stop them.  He wouldn't just simply let it happen just because he loves both of them.  Sure, it might still make him sad but it would be the easiest choice ever.
