2018-06-24T16:06:05,"This is awful. Its a romantic movie and all, sure. But that screenplay belittles women and amplifies male dominance. The only things that makes it sadder is that its been both directed, produced and written by women.  SPOILERS: The man disappears for EIGHT years only to return and be able to win everyone back just after a weeks of trying to be a good father. Not even apologising, no big gestures, nothing. The female protagonist then goes on to ask him out, herself!!!  Okay fine, I let that slide. But he runs off and disappears again. Then once he realises his mistake, he makes a sweet call and voila, all is forgiven again. He arrives at her home in the rain at night but she doesn't open the door because its late at night. I wouldve atleast appreciated it if he had slept outside her porch in the rain (hello romantic movie gestures?) but nope. Instead, she goes over to his place in the morning, again no apologies take places. She just jumps into asking him to make some promises and all is fixed again. How easy. Also, the only other adult female in the film is a psychotic publicist. So just an overall amazing portrayal of women, round of applause to the director, producers and writers.",3,3,Rania,5iEOQn8UUHI,0.10250000000000001,2018-06-24 16:06:05,False,False
