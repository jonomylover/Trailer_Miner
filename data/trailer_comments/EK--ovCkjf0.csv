2017-05-25T17:50:43,"This movie is based on ""Winter's Tale"" by Mark Helprin. The book is one of the richest and most beautiful I've ever read.  The movie format is much too short to really show more than a bare glimpse of the complicated plot. They use some rather lame plot modifications to explain things, but they fail badly.  Helprin is a conservative commentator. I disagree with many (most) of the positions he's taken, but Gods above, the man can write.  The book is not an easy read for most people. It wanders and paints pictures and tells a history all it's own. Side stories abound, and each one a gem all on it's own. It touches on everything from how a¬†newspaper is designed on how a whaling ship's profits were split, to the memories of children riding in a horse drawn sleigh, to what it takes to make a city of gold out of light and science and faith.   The ending makes you hope for white horses to ride above, and to be a hero in your own small way.  I've recommended this book to a number of friends. Most who've read it, or tried, get lost and sometimes frustrated. A few though catch a perfect moment.",1,0,James Coffey,EK--ovCkjf0,0.16975308641975306,2017-05-25 17:50:43,False,False
