I can do 1000 now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older.

In the middle of the city tucked behind Greenfield village Ford has a test track.  I know this because as a 13 year old kid we used to climb the fences and hide from security.  We watched the cars they were running and we saw the wrecks (the J car was particularly dangerous).  Shelby was the organizer but the cars were already built.  His biggest impact was replacing the European engine with a NASCAR V-8.  Not because it was more powerful but because it was as solid as a brick and could go 24 hrs.     By the way, the weakness in these Ford cars were the brakes.  The Ford cars were heavy but damn were they fast and relentless.

I forget now just where the GT40 finished. We went directly to Elkhart Lake from Ohio and tested on Tuesday.  (Jaques)Passino reared his ugly head, he was determined that I wasn't mechanic enough to take care of the GT40, so they took it away from me. I was stuck with the Snake.  Skip Scott was teamed with Augie Pabst in the GT40.  I had Dick Thompson and Ed Lowther sharing the ride in the Snake for the Elkhart 500.  Between Tuesday's test and Saturday's practice, the wizards from Carcraft (Ford's in house racing department) succeeded in screwing up the aerodynamics on the GT 40 enough to loose 4 seconds a lap and make the car almost unmanageable.  When Thompson and Lowther arrived I informed them that if the Cobra broke it was my fault, but if they didn't beat the GT40 it was their fault.   Dick was appreciably faster than Ed, so I had Dick start and finish with Ed running the shortest stint in the middle.  The GT40 and the Snake ran nose to tail for several hundred miles until the gearbox in the Gt40 failed.  The Snake came home a very credible third. Behind Jim Hall and Hap Sharp in their Chaparrals.   Our third place was threatened late in the race by a Porsche powered Lotus 23 driven by George Fulmer.   I gave Thompson a pit signal allowing him to go to 8000 rpm.  By this time Henry Ford II and his entourage had invaded our pits.  They showed great consternation at my maneuver.   With the admonishment that 5 minutes ago you bastards didn't even know my name, I threw them out of my pit.""

Truth is,  a.) Ferrari was David. Not the other way around and b.) It was Ford who fucked over Ferrari. They promised Enzo they were only going to buy his road car division - that they wouldn't touch the racing arm (Scuderia Ferrari). The racing arm was Enzo's baby and all he cared about. Lo and behold, when the lawyers came for Enzo's signature they slipped in the contract Scuderia Ferrari would also be part of the sale. That's why Enzo scrapped the whole deal and took his lawyer to lunch.

""Gran Prix"" with James Garner and ""LeMans"" with/by Steve McQueen inspired me to follow and learn about road racing. ""Ford v Ferrari"" will cover one of the great road racing stories of the 1960's.   I'm not really a fan of the ""Fast and Furious"" series of movies. In many ways, I think the lack of realism does a disservice to the (often) young people who see them.
