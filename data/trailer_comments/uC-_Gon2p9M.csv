Aubrey Lee was my Great-Grandfather and he grew up to be racist, like his family, but then came WWII and my Great-Grandaddy joined the 82nd Airborne. He jumped into France as a Sergeant very late at night on June 5th 1944.

He came home changed in many ways and that was one.   From there he voted for Ike twice helping him win Texas twice, as Eisenhower won several former Confederate states in his two elections, and from there the South changed.
