As a black man from another country, this is no different than any other American movie-only the skin colour of the actors is a darker tone. I have seen your home invasion movies as well as 'body swap' movies. See this is what I've been saying for years-the black people in America aren't some wildly different culture that will have a different ideas...you are ALL just AMERICAN. If you want diversity, try watching movies from DIFFERENT CULTURES, not the same culture with different melanin levels; that way you'll get new ideas, new concepts, new mythology, different values, different social interactions-hell, even different settings. At least that's how some of us in other countries see you. Case in point, this movie...it seems to be channeling its inner 'Invasion of the body snatchers'...only because it wants to be black focused it dramatically reduces the scale, which, because I know of a movie where more is at risk, makes it seem less impressive. Furthermore...you're going to need to have a DAMN good reason why this family in particular is being copied-they aren't famous nor do they look particularly filthy rich (just the regular rich white people type of rich in these movies...it makes sense, fuck off).

Also after the T- posing man on the beach, the little boy looks as though he has been replaced with a doppelganger wearing a mask, notice how the little boy doppelganger is the only one that dosnt show his face.He wears that white cloth mask thing. I believe it is because he is the actual boy and the doppelganger is hiding out with the real family. They even show a shot of the (presumably dopplganger) boy with scars sealing his mouth shut. Maybe this was done to keep him from telling the family the truth??  Anyway, its just a theory.

Like to the point of telling to just 'stay with him to make sure he was safe'? Now consider that the clone son (And it's obviously the rabbits are a reference to the first rabbit that was ever 'cloned' in 2002) acted animistic, like he just was simply following orders with no objections to the mother clone (similar to how there are certain families that involve children who are unusually super dependent on their families that it gets awkward).   Clones will represent the worst aspects of the family (or rather what the family wishes the other members could be and drag it up to 11) and will show extreme irony. So for example, daughter wants to become a great dancer, and clone daughter will represent those that will do whatever it takes to get that 'popularity and honor', to the point of killing others (A la black Swan).   Also, minor thing. The whole 'the song is about drugs' could be another foreshadowing to drug testing, which are mostly done on rabbits. And Jordan Peele also directed ""Get Out"", which involved themes of racism (and a slight amount of references to slavery). And most of the clones that were seen in 1:57 weren't Caucasian.

She passed it on to the father by sex and in the same way that HIV/AIDS can be passed on from a pregnant mother to their child is the same way that they got it. Don't know how the other woman fits into it.  Edit: Maybe she (the other woman) has the same disease as the mother and that's how they know each other.

Most likely its a metaphor for families in the Black Community having to resist the urge or the struggle with resisting falling into the temptation of becoming the so-called ""demonic"" version that *WHITE* Society will deemed unfit, unstable, unacceptable, or unsuitable for Americanized *white* Culture and Standards... Its a Black-American Family.... more BLACK... than actually AMERICAN... maybe considered TOO BLACK by some.... And a result of Isolated Toxic Tribalism in the Black Community/Black Family structure/unit.... Think of it...  It all started with a old-school ""RAP"" song about ""Drugs"" that was just suppose to be a cool song and was harmlessly & inadvertently trying to come across as ""cool/hip/innocent"" to this generation of young black children of THIS Generation who have no idea what that ""LIFE"" was about... But Black folks 35+ know and we consciously struggle with ""THAT LIFE"" and the temptation it brings with listening to the lyrics of old school hip hop songs that remind us of where we come from and how far we've come in spite of whatever modern injustices occurring in the Black Communities.... It's like, ""Should we let them listen to it? Should we change the station? But the song is dope! But is it actually about dope?? Wait what should I do my kids are here listening to it...""

On one hand, I understand that Christmas Day is a good day for a trailer such as this, as people are home chilling, on their laptops or phones and creating lots of buzz and it's exciting. Secondly, I understand that February may not be the best release date for a high-profile movie, and also that the later in the year a movie gets released, the better chance it stays in the minds of the Academy.                           ...That being said, I really wish that movies would limit the gap to 1 month, 6 weeks tops. The energy built up towards a film dissapates when too much time passes and people may even tire of it, yet I'm certain in this case, it won't affect this film. It's just royally annoying and frustrating. I feel the same way about political campaigns before an election. Some countries limit it to 6 months before an election, which I wished the U.S. would have.

2018-12-31T22:36:04,"Ok HERE'S EVERYTHING I GOT FROM IT - ... we understand that the Mother's character had an experience with her copy-self when she was small.. which is why she told the boy to put his shoes on when she saw the family in the driveway, and seemed a little uncomfortable during the drive to her hometown. She maybe knew what may have been coming, as well as why she was so scared of when the son walked off on the beach toward the ""Find yourself"" station that they showed .. because she did the same thing as a child (as they shown her as a kid on the beach) and she knew that her experience came with her copied self when she had entered that 'Find Yourself' booth (the image of her own self choking her) .. she then is shown explaining the gameplan to the family that should supposedly get them to win against themselves.  My take on this though, is that .. she may be the genesis of the copied family... which is why her family and friends have copied selves as well (shown when she in face to face with herself in the classroom and the black board shows the tons of duplicate bodies, on two sides of the two main duplicates in the middle, which would be them two) So POTENTIAL SPOILER : Idk maybe since the mother is the genesis of the whole thing, maybe the only way to kill them.. is to kill herself. Or sacrifice herself in some way. Which would maybe explain why the kids were driving the car trying to get away by themselves at the end. ...

It's about dopplegangers. Possibly an alternate reality where they got white people transplanted into their bodies and they came into the next to be the only ones and eliminate those people because they probably aren't fully free mentally until the other form of them from the parallel universe is taken out. Make sense? No? Kay. So in order to go DEEPER notice how Zora is dancing/ doing ballet and the thing is doing it to. They aren't free. They are bound by the main family. Also the boy and the creature boy were mimicking eachother. OR (yes I know it's a movie but I gots theories) mabye because we see the rabbits the creature family were genetically engineered and they feel bound mentally (like I said about the ballet thing) and cannot be free until they wipe out the family they were created to be.,0,0,Heather Henninger,1tzFRIQfwXg,0.06944444444444445,2019-01-01 07:25:02,True,True

A thing that I hate about Friends of mine is when they ask ""bro why do you speak so white ?"" i have heared that alot of times in private and in modern Media. And i must say this family unlike chris from Get Out speaks white. I know i must sound racist as fuck but please hear me out. Note the beginng of the trailer, how they speak and how the mum is not snapping on beat, how the Father acts on the Boat (which is called byachtch) and the scene where he tries to intimidate, the other Family with the Bat just seems so weird to me. Maybe im trippin.*  *The only eason im saying this is beacuase we learned how white people have been trying to be black and inheriting their bodies in get out.*   *Rabbits in Sciencefiction are often related to cloning. and in this Trailer we get alot of Rabbit shots. So i think the ""evil"" Family is actually the good Family, that were kidnaped, tortured ( or experimented on ) and cloned. the reason why the mum seems the most suspicious is because she is the only one who kept her memories of her old self while the rest have forgotten it but kept some of their old characteristics.*   *Well all of this wont make any sense if the movie doesn't belong to a Get Out Universe. but i still want to discusse this until the movie is released.*",1,0,Bryan Carter,1tzFRIQfwXg,-0.07355072463768116,2019-01-04 09:20:43,True,True

I think black people should leave this creepy weirdo Satanic stuff to white people. The cast starring in the demonic roles in this movie look out of place and out of character.     Instead of movies like this, it would be nice to see ""African Americans"" starring as themselves (instead of other groups of black people pretending to be ""African Americans"") in movies that are about positivity (on a regular basis).

In this generation we have too many whites stealing their culture and most famous rappers who are black are letting this happen just for money. Hes showing that because of the manipulation of todays era, the black community is not necessarily physically hurting eachother (although its happening) its more of a mental and subtle game where they arent standing together to protect eachother,  so they might as well be hurting themselves.

We did have to grant permission to them have this film shot there. Also, we got a little inside info AND an early screening of the film.  So, this African american family moved from a heavily populated black community, to a more ""white"" community. Certain bay area towns have a very high white population (SC). This is why he chose this location. Anyways, they move to this white beach town. And their white neighbors flip out. The white neighbors pretend to be democrat, loving all races. That is, Until a black family moves in next to them. And the neighbor white father works at a San Jose cloning lab. He is able to to get samples of them, DNA, picture samples of the family. And he wires the clones to have the sole enemy of ""themselves"". The whole point is to get the black family to move out of town. Basically, its a comment on humans. People are loving of other races, until a black family moves in next door. The message is. White people construct these social economic neighborhoods, ghettos, good neighboorhods. White people set it up, so black people fight, and kill amongst themselves. While the white families are on the good side of town, away from the violence. Its all socially constructed.

Idk, just me but I can remember as a kid growing up in the early 80's (4 or 5 yrs old) the r& b song ""Why You treat me so bad"" beat intro, was so melodic but seemed kinda creepy imo. The Luniz version, for me to this day, still sounds dope, a bit erie but more enjoyable bcuz its hip hop approach. Now here comes JP, with a slowed down, creepy and dark orchestrated version of ""I got Five on it"" melody replaying in head giving me goose bumps. This song and melody is now the perfect combination of a new born, horror themed movie and a couple of classic speaker bangers at the same damn time..

The Wilsons, in the film, will be revealed as clones or some such thing, made by white people to make them more acceptable to their society. The underlying metaphor and message of the movie will be about how black people are forced to cast aside their race and culture in order to appease white people and be accepted into white society, which is seen as the only way of them being able to ""move up"" in the world.    The Tethered is who they truly are, and will represent how The Wilsons have changed so much about themselves to meet the approval of white society, that they are strangers to who they use to be, to their former culture. It will end with them accepting their deaths, and either letting The Tethered take over their lives, showing how its important to, for lack of a better term, ""stay black"", and stay true to yourself and your race and culture, or it will have both The Tethered and The Wilsons dying, showing that giving up your culture in an attempt to conform to one that hateful and racist only hurts you and your people and your peoples culture in the end.

2019-03-01T03:21:47,"I have a theory about the son. Not only is he super weird in the way he acts, but he can also manipulate fire. Some examples include how his doppelg√§nger was able to light up the fireplace by just sitting in front of it. Another is when the doppelg√§nger is in front of the burning car. He is walking forward, but the fire is moving backward, as if he is somehow manipulating it. Also, when he takes off his mask in front of the real boy, there are third degree burns on his face. I also found it peculiar that they were calmly sitting in front of each other, as if they have some sort of connection, while the other doppelg√§ngers are trying to kill their doubles, such as with Elizabeth Moss‚Äôs character. I think that the plot will revolve around the son and the burns on his face, which might have been caused by some sort of a car accident. That‚Äôs my theory. Y‚Äôall I‚Äôve been thinking more about this theory and I realized what if the son IS the tethered version and the boy with the burnt face is the real son. I‚Äôm speculating that Adelaide and the son were involved in a car crash that burnt the sons face. Adelaide already knew about where the tethered lived based on her experience as a little girl so maybe she switched the two boys and now has the tethered version. maybe the tethered version of the family came to get their son back, but in the process released all of the tethered, which is why everyone else is getting killed. When the family shows up at the house, the dad and kids are all shocked, but Adelaide acts differently, as if she knows that it‚Äôs over for her and her family.

Because she's NOT a tethered. She's the original. The Tethered Young Adelaide in the flashback scenes replaced her, but by replacing her, became her so completely she forgot she wasn't ever the original. Because she abandoned and forgot about the others, they accepted the real Adelaide as one of their own (and thus Tethered Adelaide is now ""one of them"") and so she lived with them until the movie (and possibly was part of how they are now out in force?). The whole thing is supposed to be not about race, but class  this time right? The tethered being a fairly obvious message in that light: There is somebody out there, as smart as you, as capable as you, so much like you, but things didn't go so well for them so they didn't get as far. If you neglect that truth they are gonna be mad about it.

2019-03-23T15:25:31,"--- Major Spoiler Alert-----This will Spoil movie - do not read  This movie is very simple actually but well done . I think that the cover of the movie basically explains everything that Peele is masterfully trying to convey. There is a picture of the mother with tears in her eyes and a mask with a smile on it on the cover of the movie. This is symbolic of the evil, sadness, concealment, boundage and struggle that lies BENEATH this country and what you see everyday; which we consider as normal life here in the U. S. . The mother crying underneath the mask is the original mother and the smiling mask being removed is the doppelganger. This picture symbolizes What Lies Beneath the smiling doppelgangers face;a man hidden, a story hidden.   1.) The movie starts off with the crime of the doppelganger STEALING BY FORCE  the life of the original young mother and putting her in bondage, in a controlled environment, unable to flourish. So throughout the movie we sympathize with the doppelganger and she actually plays the victim in the movie. The truth is, she was created unnaturally  and committed a evil violent act to exist in her present world & location.  Her existence in the family and location she STOLE came with the PRIVILEGE of existing as; wife, mother and friend.  Note: What  I mean by created  UNNATURALLY could be as simple as  being driven by an evil implanted idea (selectively replace people) , principle or upbringing.   2.) The only way the mother's (doppelgangers) life could continue as is; was to conceal the truth of her crimes at all cost to continue her life. She had to lie and actually murder all that could provide evidence of her crime. ***That is why she was the most aggressive in the entire movie(with intent and reason) and consequentially had the largest KILL COUNT and follow through  ***.   3.) In conclusion, this movie Perfectly mirrors the accounts of the first European settlers arriving here in America and killing all inhabitants, completely Conquering the continent of Africa and enslaving its people to create life ""as we know it"" which we consider as perfectly normal. Yes, the doppelgangers are bad, most comments believe that they represent the underclass but  I think Peele totally conveys that they are here too take all that yours and replace you. I draw this comparison  due to the fact that, in the movie, The doppelgangers were manufactured and existed for all people  in the U. S. . The only way to continue the status quo in this country and beyond is to continue to steal, conceal, replace and kill. ****  I believe that the most important part of the movie is when the doppelgangers participate in keeping a perfect Unity DESPITE their insanity, symbolically representing this unity by  holding hands at the end of the movie. I think that Peele did not make the doppelgangers kill each other in an effort to convey the message of unity amongst people with the same purpose ( thievery, concealment, lies and murder). I feel that the entire movie was solely about the mother, this storyline and the premise of this comment reigning true throughout all aspects of the movie.   4.) I believe that Peele  made it where the doppelgangers resided under ground to convey the true behavior of evil. It is generally done in secret and hides. The underground places were built and exist but only known by the ones who created them and the ones using them for evil purposes. Most people are unaware of the underground spaces.   Unfortunately, we will never know what the mothers (doppelgangers) life would be like if she did not commit this crime. Maybe her life could have been better? Definitely more people would be alive and having to lie, steal, conceal and murder her entire life wouldn't be a requirement.

2019-03-23T16:16:36,"MY THEORY: *spoilers* i‚Äôve seen the movie twice already lmao  i think that jason (the real little boy) was switched the summer before because they went to the beach house last summer before their grandma died this would explain why:  -he doesn‚Äôt know where the bat is -how he doesn‚Äôt remember getting locked in the closet the summer before -how he learned new words -why he‚Äôs so clueless and strange acting  -why he wasn‚Äôt building a sandcastle at the beach and he was building a TUNNEL  -why he approached the guy on the beach with outstretched arms because he knew the plan beforehand by the real mother but he was switched -why he wasn‚Äôt afraid to back up bc he wanted to kill his ‚Äútether‚Äù (real boy) -and why he didn‚Äôt scream when the real adelaide grabbed him from behind the car  (i think that both versions of jason know english btw, but one of them burned their mouth, so now they can only scream. it is not unlikely seeing that both mothers can speak.)  what happened that summer?  an accident between the tethered boy and the real boy. the summer before perhaps the family tried to attack them but it didn‚Äôt work out because they boys were playing with fire in the closet and mistakenly burned the other boys mouth (the real one) but the plan wasn‚Äôt ready yet!! so they had to switch them out, and adelaide had taught him english beforehand. this is why he has trouble focusing because he‚Äôs always awaiting the moment for his real family to come back and seek their revenge. AND this is why HE was the one to announce to the family that there was a family in the driveway at such a strange time when he was supposed to be sleeping!!! and he didn‚Äôt even look afraid when they broke in and he didn‚Äôt HESITATE to kill his ‚Äútether‚Äù because he was the tether and he was killing the real boy  he thought the real adelaide would have survived but when he saw that the tether killed his mom he was shook as FUCK and now he has to live his life as someone he didn‚Äôt even want to be!  this would also explain why adelaide screamed ‚Äúno‚Äù as the boy was backing into the fire, and beforehand she even tried to give her hand to him like she did with jason who i presume to be the tether right before red and the family broke in  i think that this theory is possible because children are very impressionable when they‚Äôre young  and if pluto (the real jason) had his mouth burned and he could no longer speak of course he would be very angry all the time, and he‚Äôd be very angry because adelaide was not the real adelaide, so perhaps he took sides with the real mother despite being born from adelaide. this is why he has such a devotion to red, willing to do anything for her; and why he also has a very close connection to the other jason (the tethered) and how the plan worked out so smoothly, because jason was in on it all along, not trying to kill the family, no, but ultimately being the sole purpose to lure adelaide to her death by red in the tunnels, but unexpectedly red failed  and now the tethered jason has to live with someone he despises and has to keep quiet in order not to shatter his own identity   hence why he puts the mask on at the end right after adelaide puts on her ‚Äúmask‚Äù at the end by smiling as if she had done something good.",0,0,curlykidkay ‚Ä¢,1tzFRIQfwXg,0.03417901999316472,2019-03-23 16:16:36,False,True

So the evil one (doppelganger)ends up living the life of the girl in the real world and that's when she became slightly good but she knew that the real one( who stuck in the evil world) would come back that's why she didn't want to go to Santa Cruz beach it triggered flashbacks and etc. So the real one (who's portrayed as evil) comes back to get revenge basically to get her life back. And that's when in the end the real one( portrayed as evil) actually dies and the one whos portrayed as good id actually the evil she ends up living and killing the real one so she won't come back to get her life. So that's why in the end she gives her son that weird creepy smirk because he knows the truth ,he's more like her. You just have to be very observant and pay attention to every little detail after watching it lastnight I understood everything. I hope this little explanation didn't confuse you guys even more .

At least 30xs in the movie each of us can agree that we thought about what not to do or what we would have done in certain situations that was common sense. I mean come on this not the 1970s no more where ppl sit around waiting to be killed in horror movies just to keep the script going. The plot was good but the lack of common sense in the film was horrible and that's for any culture or race.  I'm sure you and your family would not wait around with ppl dead around you while watching TV instead of getting the keys and getting tf that's just one situation.

If you've seen the movie, you know at the end that who we thought was Adelaide was actually Red, and that Red switched places with Adelaide when they met in the tunnel. The comment explained that humans were inferior to the tethered (they gained strength from what humans couldn't do), and Adelaide (Red) became inferior after living with the humans for years. When talking about why she quit ballet, she said her legs gave out on her. When the daughter was explaining why she wanted to quit running, she said her legs were not strong enough. The guy who made the comment noted that Adelaide (Red) passed this onto her daughter, while Red (Adelaide) passed strength within legs onto her daughter, which is why the tethered version of the daughter could easily outrun her. Another comment noted how the son made a tunnel at the beach instead of a castle, didn't know what a baseball bat was, and drew a photo from the angle that the mom met the tethered in the tunnel (but the drawing was of Jason and the homeless man on the beach). It could be argued that Jason switched with the tethered son aswell, as the tethered son had weak legs and crawled for a majority of the movie. The only thing that wouldn't make sense about that last part would be if they switched places that soon, how would he have burned his face that quick and lost his ability to speak?

2019-03-27T20:08:26,"This is by far one of the worst movies I have seen in a VERY long time. It's a horror movie with no horror or anything at all that makes you fear anything except falling asleep while being bored to death. Typical racial stereotypes of black man is stupid and dumb while the smart black woman who is a little crazy keeps him in line, pile of garbage. So the dad is dumb ogre, the kids are little skitter monsters, and mom is the queen of the hive whose only desire is to kill the hive she was stuck with.

Different movies using the same idea and clich√©s over and over and over, over 30+ years. Just look for the horror films of the last years.  That's why I like movies like Us. In the trailer, it looks like another home invasion film, but it's so much more than that. It's not simply a horror film. It's a movie you have to watch at least twice to fully understand the meaning and all the symbols appearing since the very beginning. And the social message is relevant, something we need to talk about as a society, especially in the USA. Plus, the performance of the actors, the music and the production were great. It's a film to make you think, to make you talk. It doesn't need to have all the answers because you HAVE to think (a huge difference with common horror movies, because usually you don't need to think to understand them; they are pretty simple). If you don't understand the movie message, I recommend you to look for it in the internet. People from the United States need to understand and think about the problem.

It's not like those what I always find in big movies where it seems like a pre-fabricated story then they just try to invent extra details along the way to complete a whole movie. So I'm confused why I didn't find praises for the movie here in comments. Maybe you didn't like the movie or something?

The only one that is actually pure human was the father. Not to mention why would you automatically assume that Adelaide is Red just because she eats Strawberries and doesn't drink? Hasn't it occurred to anyone that maybe she's a vegetarian and just doesn't drink why would you automatically  jump to the fact that she's evil. And here's another fact that bugs me people claim tethers aren't capable to talk well that's not true because if that were the case then Adelaide ( The Real Red ) wouldn't of been able to learn how to talk which means the other tethers are capable to learn to how to talk has well. And for someone that people claim is so ""Evil"" Adelaide ( The Real Red) seems pretty terrified of her own people. And of course Pluto ( Jason's Tether ) is gonna mock everything Jason does because he is his clone and so of course he is gonna know all of his movements. And if Adelaide ( The Real Red ) was really a murderer and as evil as people say she is, she would've murdered Red's parents  ( The Real Adelaide ) instead of focusing on taking over her life. Sorry this comment is so long but that's just my theory on it and my personal opinion. And if it was really just about Red ( The Real Adelaide) wanting to take her life back she could've found other ways instead she to busy focusing on wanting revenge because Adelaide ( The Real Red ) took her life from her. And again Jason and Umbrae have always been half tethers because their mother is a tether so people saying Jason is a tether yes he is but only half.",0,0,LuvsHorror Movies,1tzFRIQfwXg,-0.028571428571428574,2020-06-03 17:14:26,False,False
