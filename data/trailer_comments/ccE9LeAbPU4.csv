The 4th one was really bad, so bad, that I couldn't even laugh at it, like at the other three XD.  People should watch all those ghost hunting shows, like the proven fake ""Most Haunted"" and ""Ghost Hunters / TAPS"" is also starting to fake stuff since uuuh season 2 or 3 (sadly).... no idea, if Ghost Adventures is fake yet, I hope not lol. But yeah, you get more spooked out of those three shows, than those movies XD! Destination Truth is another one, but they don't focus on ghosts alone and sometimes they just run around in the wilderness, looking for something - but still more entertaining XD.  So yeah ... don't feel bad, if those movies scare you, but they shouldn't... they aren't made good enough, imo at least. They could have done so much more with the movies. Okay, we could have let the first one slide, but then they should have put the whole marked thing with more and more clues and hints on the origins and all that into the 2nd one already.
