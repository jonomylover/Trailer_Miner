I don't like how they're bring Lion King in Live Action, it just doesn't work for me. I guess (much like other remakes) it's because we want to see our favorite Disney characters. Lion King is without a doubt gonna be the worst Disney Remake ever. Aladdin was gonna be great, ehhh....until the actor for Aladdin showed up. And my god, he's so ugly.  You guys are asking me, what remake do I want to see that Disney should develop. Well obviously, I want to see Night on Bald Mountain in Live Action, in a PG-13 style. I always want to see my favorite Disney Villain break back into the main stream audience. Chernabog is the most important villain of the Disney Franchise, he's the reason why all your favorite Disney Villains gained power, or become evil (much like him). And if there's anyone who can play as him in CGI, it will have to be Andy Serkis. He's too perfect to be the actor in a CGI Chernabog. Aside from that, I also want to see Little Mermaid (Please cast Natalia Dyer for Ariel, because she looks and sounds a lot like her), and Snow White. They are great Disney classics, and they deserve remakes. Also, Maleficent 2 looks like a good idea. I actually get to meet Elle Fanning at London during my summer vacation. And she is really excited.  But sadly, this movie looks a little bit....bad. So, I'm just gonna save my money, and wait for Chernabog's film to be out soon. So, I think The Lion King remake will probably be the worst movie of 2019. Sorry......",0,0,SP/Goji Fan,O9EvBdzHvqI,0.11148268398268397,2018-11-23 01:34:08,True,True

The dim lighting and complex hair animation over shadows some essential details. This movie seems like it's target audience is a bit mixed. Young children will enjoy it, but it might not be as memorable as the original. I guess teenagers and adults can revisit this movie with a new eye and enjoy the improved graphics? but I don't really feel the familiarity of the characters...

I fear it will come off as a lesser version of the original albeit new and shiny and flashy and nostalgic and make a lot of money.

Toy Story 4 and Gigantic) and these are more like filler in between them. Besides if all I had to watch was an okay Cinderella remake and a gorgeous update to the Jungle Book to get to Zootopia, I'll gladly take an interesting/fresh look at Dumbo, an Aladdin remake with Will Smith as the Genie (good cast choice), and a Lion King remake that still looks incredible and just fills my heart with joy if it leads to Gigantic and everything Disney and Pixar have coming up! Also these movies don't tarnish the originals, the originals still exist just go watch that instead! I'm excited for the new take on the Lion King. Donald Glover is an amazing choice and bringing back the iconic voice of Mufasa was a good call. While Scar feels irreplaceable, I have faith in Chiwetal Ejiofor as his voice better matches the feel this movie is going for, not to mention the fact that he's just an amazing actor who kills it!

But, where is the rest of the original cast? Jeremy irons, the bird and monkey actor (they could be dead) Johnathan Thomas Taylor as young simba and that Brandon guy from terrible Godzilla as adult Simba... Hell you couldn't of got Whoopi? That worries because it makes me feel like you're going to either add new or explore a different side of the story which is dangerous... Or, you're going to scrap the whole story for a new take on the entire story 2) understand Disney... This movie is not for the kids, you're main audience will be those of us who grew up on this film, using our kids as a excuse to go see this so... If you add or explore a different take on the film or if you move the story in a different direction... Understand that will be the death of Disney, this movie will either set history records for the best, or the most hated and I don't think Disney can take a hit even a small one from ""Bad score"" on this movie. How many times do people get mad when  in the trailer screen writers and directors say this bullshit ""you think you know the whole story?, think again""..... Me:Um, yea... Kinda been reading it my whole life, existed for decades before so you adding some stupid shit doesn't make you're story the OG, you're a fake posing to be real 3)KEEP THE STORY THE SAME!!! : again this is for adults who grew up on this, you already fucked up the casting besides Earl, you will not recover from this failure...

Since the old lion king has been in ""lets just say"" bad quality to what is available, we should be thanking them for the nostalgic feel in HD , not cartoonic...

The struggle for identity during young adult years. First love. Not giving up. Fighting for justice ect.  But overall I've got to say, my favourite is the European Pagan themes of Reincarnation, Rebirth via Reproduction, and Redemption run so deep. ""He Lives in You"", is an incredibly powerful song. Also, the way in which the European Writers so beautifully depict the spirit & nature of Africa, is phenomenal. There's a really deep respect there, and its art like this which inspires everyone, to have hope in an idea Greater, and to aim for something higher.  The original is, maybe not the most entertaining musical of all time, but EASILY the GOAT musical overall.   ""Circle of Life"", ""We Are One"", ""Just Cant Wait To Be King!"", ""Be Prepared!"", ""He Lives in You"", ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight?""  *What other musical has this many ABSOLUTE CLASSICS??

Soon there will be actual animals mutated and put straightly into movie acting.  Or direct robots, programmed to be fully formed up and ready to do some actors career, and then in the future, those robots will be scrapped, or sold for fucking high price, just to make the makers of those robots have for example their kind of huge egoes grown, just to feel superior.  Like we are so fucking stupid, that we respect these great leaders, be it for our eyes seemingly those movie makers, actors, etc, just everything, where things reminds us all without doubt some movie itself, especially quite easily a comedy movie, for just look at us, humans, how fucking stupid we are?   Well anyways, just yes yay another one of those movies indeed, made from previous old stuff, just tried to improve the lookalikes of them, etc.  It's also ridiculous how we live. Like there are commercials for all of us to see, like then we look at them, and register something awesome from it, like ""Huh, well i will be, there is something awesome out there, etc."" like we are sort of being programmed in some ways to live what we are being offered, and do not really think about them at all.

""The Lion King"" (original) is a fantastic movie back then and still is a great animated movie. The animation on the original felt more appealing to younger and even older audiences. Mainly because of the impressive motions of the characters themselves that express who they are. Color scheme for many of the back rounds was really good as well. If this 3D version manages to surpass or be just as good as the original, then it's an alright movie. I just hope they don't fuck it up massively.

If you were 4,5,6 when those movies came out they were your introduction to theater, to visual entertainment, hell to disney and movies in general. I still remember the trailer in 94 and can compare it to this trailer 24 years later. its different if you watched lion king when it was released, in the cinema with your family and friends. this and aladdin will always hold the most special place to us. whoever is 30+, i know exactly what you felt when you watched this. no matter how good or bad the movie will be, the nostalgia will be worth it alone. enjoy your day fellows",0,2,neon,O9EvBdzHvqI,0.18248299319727893,2018-12-15 05:24:10,True,True

You can't tell me that you could see any more than a hint of humanlike emotion on Raffiki's or Simba's face in this trailer.

I really try to be optimistic about new stuff and directions in pop culture and art but its hard to put a bow on it or say it any other way. these movies are the soulless height of the remake/reboot cancer that's hurting the film industry so deeply. even when the try to fix their past mistakes like giving female characters more agency and being more interesting or cast actors of colors in roles made for them it doesn't make up for all of this. the only light at the end of the tunnel is that despite how deep the Disney back catalog is they will run out of them eventually.,0,1,Fite-4-Ever,O9EvBdzHvqI,0.041955266955266954,2019-04-12 02:00:11,True,True
