Totally hyped up rubbish with scenes that would just not happen in real life such as walking through the streets of New York with a guy strapped to a so called bomb and everyone there all cheering him on within a metre from them.  The streets would have been evacuated and all sorts.  If anyone has half a brain you would pick the crap out this film from start to finish with the things that are going on that just would not happen.  At least make a film like this believable it's terrible.  I was in a room with 5 other Englishman who all walked out and couldn't be bothered to waste there time watching it.  I stayed till the end due to needing to see how bad it really was.   Lol.,0,0,Michael Hardy,va-0o_xBVnU,-0.18843700159489632,2016-08-14 07:22:16,False,False

Notice how all the men are greedy or stupid and the women are there to do what's right because the men are incapable of doing so. 'The police are trigger happy and too aggressive.'
