2018-01-04T08:16:05,"A better DEATH WISH movie would have recontextualized the original story around current events by portraying Kersey as a pacifistic, liberal white man turned cold vigilante killer of mostly black criminals. While Kersey privately considers his actions to be of a MORAL character, show BLM protesters frame his actions as inherently RACIAL in character. Portray the national media as being  disinterested in the killings of black gang members and/or aiding the protesters. Have a police commissioner genuinely interested in arresting Kersey [while building an inaccurate suspect profile] being occasionally obstructed by a police force that mostly identifies with the killer. Make the movie about collective cognitive dissonance and competing narratives struggling to define the social and historical nature of current events [Kersey's fictionalized vigilantism] with each side falsely caricaturing what they each oppose and have projected onto it.  It would make the city streets of Detroit feel increasingly claustrophobic leading to a Wild Bunch standoff/chase sequence between Kersey, street gangs, protesters, and police in the climax.

2018-03-15T14:52:34,The original movie is priceless but it will be interesting to see if they make something great or if its just a remake filled with propaganda. The original with Charles Bronson is a masterpiece. The trailer seems to lack seriousness and so I imagine the movie is not going to have as much impact as the original which allowed you to put yourself in the world of the movie and ask yourself what would you do - because it felt like a real world. Not a fan of movies being filled with cheesey stuff as it detracts from any immersive potential of the movie.
