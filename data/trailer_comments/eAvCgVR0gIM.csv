With Freya's ability to freeze any enemy, the young ice queen has spent decades in a remote wintry palace raising a legion of deadly huntsmen ‚Äì including Eric and warrior Sara ‚Äì only to find that her prized two defied her one demand: Forever harden your hearts to love.  When Freya learns of her sister's demise, she summons her remaining soldiers to bring the Magic Mirror home to the only sorceress left who can harness its power. But once she resurrects her sister Ravenna from its golden depths, the wicked sisters threaten this enchanted land with twice the darkest force it's ever seen.

2015-12-11T22:09:50,So if this is a sequel then which is what I heard. Why isn't Chris Hemsworth aka The Huntsman not with the one we thought he truly loved  at the end of the film before Snow White aka Kristian Stewart?Also Charlize Theorans character seems to have been resurrected by her younger sister who we didn't even here about or see in a flash back from the previous film.We know the evil queen had a brother who died in the last movie but we never saw Emily Blunts more menacing version of Elsa from Frozen. I thought this were a sequel because  I thought the  warrior woman with the ginger hair who looked to be the huntsman's childhood friend was meant to be his previous wife from SW & TH who was stated to be dead. But oh no after the longing of not being of seemingly ever to find love again being a widower then coming across Snow White who may just make him fall in love once again and move on from mourning. Well it looks like hes seemed to easily move on from Snow White to somee one new.WHAT?,0,0,Owen Shore,eAvCgVR0gIM,0.0062500000000000056,2015-12-11 22:09:50,True,True

The story so sappy, there was no chemistry between the two main characters at all, I mean there was more sexual tension between Ravenna and Eric, than him and his wife. You could get over the overly sweet story about love, but all the illogical stuff...ahhh. I mean he fell with great force on his shoulder and didn't at least dislocate it, then got stabbed in the abdomen at least few time and didn't even bleed, the girl broke her freaking back and walked like nothing happened, but the queen got stabbed only two times and bled out ( WTF?). And the fact that she tried to save them from Ravenna didn't mean anything for them ( I don't even know how to comment on the fact, that for somewhat 20 years they were told that love does not exist, and you could say brainwashed, but one word from Eric and they all turned against their queen). Oh, the scene where Freya was dying and in stead of trying to help her or something, they were going to make out right in front of her dying body.

2016-08-06T22:34:08,"The only thing I disliked about this movie is that they focused too much time and story on ""the good guys""/the good guy squad. And while they were the ones I was rooting for in the first movie, they were quite dull here. I wished there was more screen time and more of a story revolving around the queens and perhaps   (SPOILER ALERT DON'T READ THIS SEPARATE PIECE OF TEXT HERE IF MOVIE NOT SEEN not have them turn against each other or at least not so soon)   END SPOILER ALERT  Because that just took so much time away which would've been much more interesting to have seen spent on the sisters working together and owning the kingdom. The heroes in this story kind of bored me. The huntsman with the ""stronger"" witch would've also been fun to have seen, I think they've got a nice dynamic, but unfortunately much of that wasn't in there either.    Long story short: I'd like the movie to have spent more time on the witches/sisters/queens and even on the huntsman and *the* queen (not the ice queen). And maybe have the ice queen be a little more charismatic, I know she's like this for a reason, but in my opinion I'd just have liked to have seen her to be more like the other one (Ravenna).   Other than that I liked it. Perhaps they might/could implement some of that stuff I wrote into the next movie? That'd be great (at least for me).",0,1,IIsuperstarII,eAvCgVR0gIM,0.2040509259259259,2016-08-06 22:34:08,False,False
