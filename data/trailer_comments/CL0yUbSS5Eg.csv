2016-12-02T01:35:40,"John 6:46 says “not that anyone has seen the Father except he who is from God; he has seen the Father.” And 1 Timothy 6:14-16 says, “to keep the commandment unstained and free from reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, which he will display at the proper time—he who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords, who alone has immortality, who dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has ever seen or can see…”  Tell me, please, how it is that William Paul Young thought it would be Biblically sound to portray a physical representation of God the Father given the above Biblical testimony? And this is just one of the many Theological errors found in Mr. Young's book. He says, in his book, that God the Father suffered on the cross by showing scars in His hands; this is heresy called Patripassionism. It was Jesus, God the Son, who suffered on the Cross, not the Father. Another is Jesus saying, ""I am the best way any human can relate to Papa [the Father] or Sarayu [the Holy Spirit]. To see me is to see them."" No, He isn't, ""the best way."" He is the only way. Period.  I don't expect this little excerpt to change anyone's mind. There have been many sermons, articles, podcasts, and even books written by very intelligent pastors and theologians like Albert Mohler and John Piper condemning the egregious errors in this book; but please have some discernment while you consume this kind of material.",72,36,CmRoddy,CL0yUbSS5Eg,0.290625,2016-12-02 01:35:40,True,True

2017-02-08T17:31:15,"I am so sorry to see this book turned into a movie, this is a dangerous misrepresentation  of theology ever. At sec 1 of this trailer is a spiral garden and the representation of the tree of life. Look up the spral in the occult, not satanism, Luciferianism, but it ia a more bueatiful looking heap of garbage.Red flags should go up to those who want the truth and look for it. Yes, I read that book and even though it had me glued to it, something was wrong with the portrayal of God as a black woman and her explanations of what they know nothing about or care to. They lure you in with the ""I can sympathize with this man"" hook. Yes, if we can't, there is something wrong with us, But the fairytale starts with so called heaven and god as a woman. God is not a woman and why would He appear as such. He has Christ that represents Him, Jesus is the one with all authority. People need to do some reading and research of this feminine, god they have here. It doesn't matter? No, it does matter, they will believe a lie. Not one word in the book speaks of Jesus Christ, the one that is at the center of all creation and all authority. I wonder what else we can find in this movie, (since hollywood is dead set against truth and is a land of fantasy and deception) that sybolizes the new Luciferian age, the new age. I guess you might realize this down the road, but not too late. Jesus is the Savior, if not your savior, He will be your judge. I read here of all the people who cried just from this trailor, I would cry just at the deception and portrayal of this book. If you just watch movies and get entertained by the world and expect to learn from the world, you will be entertained to death, the death I speak of is eternal. Lucifer, as the so called ellite call him, doesn't care what you believe, as long as you do not believe and know the true God. This stinks of this influence. It gets to me that God is a godess in this movie. Goddess worship has been at odds with God since the beginning, so many roads to decpetion, but they lead to the same distination. Open a bible and learn about the true God, His Son, and the Holy Spirit, you will learn more truth in it then this movie. Fear of God is the start. Every single person is elligible for what He has offered every man on earth, an enternal life that is incomprehensible beyond our imagination and help in this life, otherwise you will be sucked in to this world propaganda with far less than satisfaction, far less, then there will still be Judgement. I liken this to the Superbowl half time show, but they are more blatant, this is so sutble, suble as a serpent, don't get bit. Jesus was here to divide, the goats from the sheep, the wheat from the tares. This division is nessessary, He will reign on earth for 1000 yrs and you do want to be here for that. It is only for the believers, He died for every single sin, but He could not die for the sin of unbelief. The sin of unbelief of what He accomplished on the cross for YOU, is the sin that will seal our faith. It is coming up very soon. Don't take anyones word for it, do what many have and are doing, learn it for yourself.",72,49,burly636,CL0yUbSS5Eg,-0.025468975468975474,2017-02-08 17:31:15,True,True

This book turned movie is a promotion of what is referred to as the “Social Trinitarian” view of the Trinity and it is heretical.  Social Trinitarianism is inseparably connected with Universalism. Notable Social Trinitarianists are Brian McLaren and Karl Barth, both Universalists.  Many holding this view when pinned down would deny they are Universalists however, those that embrace Social Trinitarianism and deny Universalism, and this is important,  are inconsistent.  Social Trinitarianism when carefully understood MUST lead to a denial of the core doctrine of the atonement, hell is erased, holiness of God becomes moot, and like a wet paper bag the whole thing falls apart.  In the end, Social Trinitarians refuse the death of Christ and his covering of our sins as the core of salvation.",1,0,Shane Haffey,CL0yUbSS5Eg,0.09603174603174602,2017-02-15 16:49:03,True,True

2017-03-01T13:23:39,"Young’s stereotypical characterization of the Father as a “large beaming African-American woman,” the Son as a Jew with a large nose, and the Holy Spirit as a mysterious Asian female3 makes me more than a little queasy. Furthermore, virtually every theological heresy begins with a misconception of the nature of God. The Shack is no exception. After chiding those he believes to have misconceptions about the Trinity, Young proceeds to compromise, confuse, or outright contradict biblical orthodoxy. He pictures the Father bearing crucifixion scars as well as being incarnated in tandem with the Holy Spirit. In historic, biblical Christianity only the Son is incarnated and only the Son suffers and dies on the cross. Moreover, Young pontificates that Jesus “has never drawn upon his nature as God to do anything” (emphasis in original). Those who have read through the Bible will immediately recognize the falsity of this statement—particularly with respect to the resurrection. For example, in John’s Gospel Jesus says, “The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down my life—only to take it up again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This command I received from my Father” (John 10:17–18 NIV). Equally problematic is the fact that Young negates the notion of functional subordination within the Godhead. As the large beaming African-American woman in Young’s novel explains, the Trinity is “in a circle of relationship, not a chain of Command.…Hierarchy would make no sense among us” (emphasis in original). In biblical orthodoxy, however, the incarnate Christ says, “I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself; He can do only what He sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does” (John 5:19 NIV). Put another way, functional hierarchy is not antithetical to ontological equality. Finally, Young has Jesus—the Jew with the big nose—declaring, “I’m not a Christian” and “I have no desire to make them [Buddhists, Mormons, Muslims, etc.) Christian.” Indeed, Young describes Christians as religious fanatics and part of a sinful world system. In sharp distinction, the followers of Christ adopted the word “Christian” in the midst of suffering and persecution. The apostle Peter, for example, writes, “If you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed but praise God that you bear that name” (1 Pet. 4:16 NIV; cf. Acts 11:26). The fact that The Shack is being touted by those who take the sacred name of Christ upon their lips is a sad commentary on Christian discernment. As has been well said, “If you haven’t read The Shack, don’t.” —Hank Hanegraaff Hank Hanegraaff is host of the Bible Answer Man broadcast heard daily throughout the United States and Canada.

2017-03-04T03:33:40,"Beware of ""The Shack"" movie: William P. Young's best selling book The Shack is considered by many solid Bible-based ministries to contain New Age teachings, and even occult overtones. The movie is probably worse since images can be very powerful. If by any chance you think this is a Christian movie, it is not!!! The book and movie contain Universalist teachings. The story embraces the false doctrine of universal Reconciliation. The character travels to the shack and finds it renovated into a beautiful cottage with three persons in residence: a breezy, cheery African-American woman who likes to cook and who gives her name as Elousia; Jesus, a short Middle-Eastern man always at work in a shed; and an Asian looking woman named Sarayu who is ""keeper of the gardens."" Mack soon learns that Elousia is Papa -- God the Father -- and Sarayu is the Holy Spirit. Jesus is, of course, Jesus. I believe it is heretic, deceiving and dangerous to immature Christians or anyone, for that matter. 1 Tim. 4:1-2",0,0,Karina Guidi,CL0yUbSS5Eg,0.15175757575757573,2017-03-04 03:33:40,False,True

Plus, I don't know why y'all are trippin' that the actor who plays Papa is black. Why not? It's not like white people are any better than black people. We took care of this 53 years ago ok people? Next, the problem that people have with the Holy Spirit portrayed by a woman. First of all (again) why not? Why should the Holy Spirit be portrayed as a man? In the bible, nothing gives the holy spirit a gender, but I guess you could infer that it is a male because of the one-in-three thing. However, in the bible, women are referred to as 'helpers'. The Holy Spirit is also referred to as a helper. Connections. So all you critics, just shut up. No one is accepting this as doctrine, as you insanely state.

In the scripture the Father is exalted and declared as a spirit in MASCULINE ways. In the scripture the Holy Spirit comes in the form of a dove or tongues of fire, not a physical human being as Sarayu. Plus presenting the Trinity as three human forms is blasphemous. In the movie ""Papa"" tells Mack she knows no wrath, and is fond of everyone. She is downplaying SIN,  and she doesn't ""need to punish anyone"". Then what about Hell? God is The Judge of Judges and he has made this clear, saying there will be Judgement Day and People will be punish according to their sins and if they had accepted him. In the movie, it denies this, then what was the whole point of Jesus dying for us if (according to the movie) there is no such thing as repentance of sin?

I have not read the book or seen this movie but will now as I am interested in trying to understand why people would turn away from anything that does not agree with their beliefs.    We have minds that allow us to be critical thinkers and creatures.  If someone disagrees with anything so quickly because it is different than them, then we all lose.  To me, this seems to be rooted in a fear bases view of faith.   If you do not see or feel God's presence in everything and everyone around you, then the true message of Christ is lost.  We are so small in the landscape of life so if someone thinks they know it all and the truth is only one way, you don't understand true love and compassion.  Hatred of any kind how no place in people who say they beliee in God or   Movies challenge us, entertain us and expand our world.  It allows us to enter intelligent conversation to wonder, question and deepen our own beliefs.  If we assume we know it all then our ego is getting in the way.  Even Catholic priests question and struggle with many concepts in the bible.  Take from it what feeds your soul and leave the rest.  To criticize the movie and anyone who may believe that God could be a woman sheds light on deeper issues with such limited thinking.  Humans have been debated and fought over interpretations of the bible for centuries.  Where has it gotten us?  We have become less tolerant and small minded.   Model the love your faith teaches.  Christ was a rebel, embrace that.   Others scorned and even killed people who were different; Christ showed love and compassion and said that was not the way.  Loosen up the gripe that is so tightly squeezing out the true message of Christ.

2018-03-25T08:44:33,"I remember being at one of my lowest points in life about 10 years ago. I had grown up in abusive foster/adoptive homes, and my little sister was kidnapped when I was 8. My entire childhood I blamed myself for not protecting her after I had promised my birth mum I would always be there for her.  I was adopted by a pastoral family a few years later and one day my youth pastor took me aside and gave me The Shack to read, not promising anything, just hoping I wasn't going to make a bad choice with my life. I couldn't put it down that night. I read through it and poured myself into the pages. The next morning I remember my parents asking me what had happened, what was this change they had seen over night. Now my dad is a traditional pastor; he's got no time for fantasies, just his work with God. I passed him the book and challenged him to read it. He went out a few days later and but over 100 copies to take with him on his missions trips. This is who I had always seen God as, and I saw my family completely change their views on faith because of a great author's insight to Grace.

2018-06-09T22:29:30,"peoplke look at all religiuos movies as motives for why they are corrupt.. and im like thinking... people are fooling themselfs. why do you want all reasons for why a movie is corrupt then take the good points and concepts into your lifes? this doesent make sense  1. God in this movie is a black woman called papa. people say that blasphemy. why? how big is your God. God created evrything and he cant be a woman? let alone black? well we have the bible saying God is a father. so? God can do anything and evrything. if he wanna interact with this world, maybe he shows up in this world as a homeless man. maybe he can make himself look like a sporty albino woman, i mean. satan transformed himself into a snake. and it unrealistic that God can look like a black woman? God looking like a black woman is not a contradiction to his very nature in the first place. its just a diffrent appearence of him. thats all. in Narnia God was a lion. i mean cmon xD. is that blasphemy? i dont think people understand what that means at all. God being portrayed as something diffrent then we all imagen he was. thats not blasphemy. whats blasphemy is portraying God in something he is not. so how can we understand who God realy is? by reading the bible!  2. who is God? well there is many people having diffrent first impressions or opinions on this matter. based on what? how they read the bible. stereo typicly people having problems with God turns to the old testament. and turn to all the storys of how God killed people. first off. there is a diffrence between first testament and the old. the old testament is for the jews to defend as they live by that. the new testament is what we christians live by. so using the old testament to prove who God realy is... is realy not the best thing you can do. but lets go to the old testament. lets talk about the old testament. did God change from the old to the new? naw. then how come he killed in the old testament and not the new? how is it God didn change when he stopped killing in the new testament?  3. i will go into all of these points :3 but if we are gonna talk about God. assume you are God. you created the earth. you put people on earth and wanted people to live this awesome life in a very beautyful garden. right? what happened. Adam and Eve sin. they got corrupt. and they didn take responsibility. they point fingers at eachother. so what is the reasonable thing to do? make them pay a price right? how would you raise your kids if they did something you told them not to do. and when you know they did it anyway, and then lie to your face. how would you handle that? make them pay a price right? thats what happened to Adam and Eve. they could no longer experience this beautyful place God gave them. they were thrown out and started to populate the earth. so what happen from this point on? we see many examples over and over again. that God cared for people. he had clear desires to love and guide people despite evrything that happened. but whats diffrent in the old testament from the new. jesus didn die on the cross yet. so there was only so much forgiving you could receive before you crossed a line. God was the law back then. you could do bad things and repent. but if you did a bad enough thing. the punishment was death.  4. was that bad? why? imagen you are in God shoes. your only desire is to Guide people. use them for your will. what will? getting them to heaven, hen you may say. if Gods only desire is for evryone to enter heaven, why didn he create human in heaven? personally i think its because we would take evrything that was good for granted. when we are put on this life we understand evrything about what is hard. we learn about pain. horrible things ect. and so, when we then meet God. we value evrything that is good about him all the more. so, if you use people to guide others into heaven. what happens if 1 person rebels? people absorb that bad attitude and join that stupid person rebelling against God. hundreads of thousends would rebel against God. and for what`? because they are a group of people who understand stupid stuff? remember. if they stay with God. they enter heaven and live forever. if they leave God they wont enter heaven. if God see that one person rebell against him. and make hundreads, thousends of others do it too. i think its enough reason to take that one person out so God can save as many people as possible. so what happened in Moses to,e and this big city God destroyed? people look at this they think God is horrible for killing alot of people, including children. realy? were people horrible for killing, raping, stealing. having incest.. you know... people were corrupt to the very core of their hearts. because all they were focusing was to do what made them feel Good. God put a stop to it. and how did this entire massacre start? God told Moses how he would do this thing. and what you could do to prevent being killed. paint the doors to your house with goat blood. that was how God would not kill you. alot of people did so. alot of people didnt. but people knew what they could do to stop being killed. i guess they just didn take Gods word for it.  5. its funny how people use these examples to prove how horrible is. but when he didn show up under what Hitler did. or what Stalin did. God was horrible!. so eitherway God is to blame for how much losers people are. my God... people dont want wanna belive. if anything. they want all reasons why they dont belive.. thats tragic. people think the bible sais you are to treat people horrible? then why did God kill and end horrible people? if anything he regretted making people because he saw all the corruption people braught into the world. see? God regretting? that means he is a stupid blind ignorant bitch who doesent know what he was doing.. no thats not what it means xD. regretting doesent mean that. people had a free will to choose. and they chose to become corrupt because they wanted evrything that made them feel good. thats what made people corrupt. and thats why God wanted to wipe out the entire earth population and get a fresh new start with Noah.. there is no contradiction here to who God realy is because he wanted to stop evil from happpening. notice something else. God took choises to stop evil. its not biblicle commands for how jews should live out their faith. the bible doesent command evil like people think. if it did, the jews would be the first ISIS to ever exist  6. so what became realy diffrent from the old testament with the new? Jesus. Jesus was the living word of God. evrything he did was to show who God realy is. he said so over and over ""i am doing what my father wants, and not what i want"" do we have any clear evidence of Jesus being horrible? nah. not 1. not one. he loved evryone he ever met. jews seperated woman and men. and men was alot of times never around woman.. because that is how judaism worked back then. im not sure. Jesus went up to woman and loved them and told them about his father. Jesus didn care about religiuos rules and laws. people wanted to kill Jesus for breaking jewish laws. how about that? huh? Jesus healed sick people. he raised them up from the dead. he made blind people see, but because he did such thing on the sabbath. jews wanted to kill Jesus. you find no example in the bible that he wanted to hurt people. at best he whipped corrupt people out of a temple for making it a den of thieves. so what is so special about Jesus that we didn have to live by the old testament? let me answer that, ok. Jesus said in matthew 5. 17-20 that he come to fullfill  the law. what does that mean? evrything God has set into motion. evrything God demanded belivers for how they were supose to live. Jesus took all that up on himself and made it fullfilled. meaning, it was over. it was done. we didn need to live by those laws and rules anymore because Jesus took all that up on himself and crucified it all on the cross. the cross... is the moste valueble thing that symbolizes christianity. why is that? when Jesus looked at us people. what he saw was lost famely. lost sons and daughters of a living God. and so Jesus wanted to reveal our true value by bleeding so we didn have to bleed. when we was the ones who deserved to bleed. Jesus didn deserv it. but he was a pure man so he could buy off a debt none off us could ever pay off. sin. how did he pay it off? when Jesus died on the cross. and raised from the dead. what came out of that was giving meaning to foregiveness. Jesus dieing gave foregiveness so much meaning it saved our lifes. if you did bad stuff you shouldn do. if you hurt people. if you break the law. you can walk away from all that by asking Jesus to forgive. you may have to pay a price for it in the natural. but atleaste now you got Jesus on your side.. what does that mean? evrything you have done bad. is wiped off. you starting fresh. with clean slate, and you got second chanses to start over. this....! is the  true meaning of christianity!",0,0,jarl Sigurd Storvann,CL0yUbSS5Eg,-0.04919050286567893,2018-06-09 22:29:30,False,False

In extreme they are ushering in the antichrist and pulling lukewarm Christians into the very deceitful circle. But do not believe me if you do your research and find out what these bands have behind them and do your research on them you will totally understand what I am saying. May the Lord keep you and help you understand peace be with you. This message is aimed at the film The shack and the Hillsong Worship you only have to look all the people there and the money generated if someone truly loves music they are not looking for fame they are looking for worship it isn’t called Hillsong Worship for nothing. We are taught never to follow our heart or our own understandings it will fool us every time but trust in Jesus and use our minds. Just look at the worship these people are getting and the Lord God is the only one worthy of worship.no one else, 1st commandment you shall have no gods before me and that is exactly what we are making these people they are making you think you are worshiping Jesus when you are not you are worshiping them and I false Jesus.
