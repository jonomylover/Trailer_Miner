2018-11-01T18:11:01,"You don't know how wrong this film is. I am so mortified by the fact that children and their families are being exploited once again for money. If this was biological parents doing these things they'd have their kids ripped out of their arms, homes and lives forever so they can child-traffick bio families children for money. Don't believe me just Google it and Google Georgia Tann. CPS, Adoption n family court profit from terminating parental rights. There is no profit, gain, or reward for reunification of parents with their children. Don't believe me just Google how much CPS makes for every child in foster care and for every child that is placed for adoption. You think that oh they only take kids that are truly abused. Wrong, guess again. Kids are more likely to suffer from abuse or neglect at the hands of strangers then they are with their own biological families. And even if a child is abused by a parent the non offending parent or other family members don't get the kids. Why bc they are all labeled as bad. Why bc there isn't any money in kinship placement. Don't believe me, then google the facts. Senator Nancy Schafer was investigating the corrupt system when she and her husband were suddenly killed. You can Google that fact also, please do. I beg you to do the research and learn the truth about CPS, Adoption n family court. Don't do it for me, don't do it for yourself. Do it for all of the innocent children that are being trafficed daily. CPS, Adoption n family court are an evil corporation and should be abolshed. It's cruel and unusual punishment for the children, parents and families. Please don't by into this Adoption propaganda.

The remaining 85% of children are wrongfully removed through illegal means and coercion.  Often times these children are abused and neglected in these foster homes.  Approximately 85% of these children will become homeless by the age of 21.  It is inconceivable to believe that millions of American parents are so horrible as to be denied their GOD given right, not to mention Constitutional Rights, to raise their own children.  This nation was built on the principles of Life, Liberty, and Justice.  Where is the justice for those families wrongfully denied their rights to be a family?

Many of the children taken are kidnapped based on some fictional flaw the workers see, not to mention you aren't allowed to sue them legally or they'll take more of your children and try to destroy your life.
