There is the ability to track thousands upon thousands of devices yes, whether they're all looked at is an entirely different subject. And I don't believe they could for EVERY phone in the world at once, but they could track any phone they were specifically after.  This was typical of Snowden, which he should have know better - to act and portray that people sit there at a computer and watch you through your webcam, or browse through your emails etc... this doesn't happen. There isn't enough manpower to do such a task, yet alone it be worth paying for.   Why else does companies like Google collect data? To prioritize product search or customer satisfaction. Companies like the NSA track data, and then sub-categorize searches for words, tabbed cell phones for known criminals, searches for specific items, duration, repetition etc they're done so that they can filter out the bad guys from the average citizen. And, to the disgust of the many it seems, you can really only achieve that with mass collection of data, then sift through it with technology...not people.   In my opinion - he's a traitor. He said he wanted to help make a difference in the world, and he would have known that spying happens everywhere for security reasons, so why does he take this and run to Russia? At least man up to the fact you've betrayed your country, possibly at the risk of others as well.

2016-06-27T15:40:59,I am fully supportive of what Snowden has done making America aware that the CIA and NSA are watching us but I disagree with his methods. He exposed illegal activity with all good intentions but he's also compromised the tactics of the men and women who are out in the field just doing their jobs making America safe and now he will have to live in Russia probably for the rest of his life and we all know that the CIA is watching him all day every day waiting for the order to put a bullet in his brain. Had Snowden gone to a higher authority like say the Supreme Court with his findings they might have actually been able to do something about it and keep the agencies from hacking into our lives plus he wouldn't have had to run. At the end of the day by all definitions he is a traitor and the second he steps back onto American soil they'll put him in solitary confinement. ,2,6,The Spectacular Gonzo,9KyltHXrxVk,0.1946969696969697,2016-06-27 15:40:59,True,True

On the one hand, you want idealistic patriotic people who will diligently do their job and won't be easily corrupted by a foreign intelligence agency.  On the other hand, these are precisely the sort of people who might sincerely object to some practice and decide that their conscience demands that they go public.  If you hired somebody who honestly said, ""This is a good job that pays well and I will follow the rules in order to keep my job"" someone like that is more likely to follow the rules without a question and not do anything to endanger their job or to risk prison but that mercenary attitude might also make them more vulnerable to being paid off by a foreign intelligence agency.  My guess is that the NSA, CIA etc. is probably looking for people who are idealistic and motivated by the idea of public service but who have a weak sense of individualism and the idea that right and wrong are an individual judgement call.

2016-09-15T02:32:52,"""Snowed By Snowden: Identifying A Marxist False Opposition 'Whistleblower'""  How did Edward Snowden fly directly from Hawaii International Airport to Hong Kong, a city under the de facto control of Beijing? Those holding Top Secret clearance, as did Snowden, can’t fly to locations controlled by Marxist governments unless they’re  cleared for such travel, otherwise TSA computers flags the passport of  the Top Secret holding traveler, immediately alerting FBI  Counterintelligence of the incident. The offending traveler is then  detained by TSA until the FBI arrives for the pickup and subsequent  interrogation.  Hong Kong's defense and foreign affairs are administered directly by Beijing, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong is 'elected' by a 1,993 member committee that is heavily weighted to do Beijing's bidding. The Chief Executive also appoints (and dismisses) judges, and appoints government officials, such as the head of police, providing Beijing with indirect control of Hong Kong's domestic scene. So then, how did Edward Snowden fly directly from Hawaii to a de facto Communist location without his  passport being flagged by TSA computers, and TSA computers then failing  to notify FBI Counterintelligence computers? Those holding Top Secret  clearance can't travel to a Communist location unless given permission  to.   The Edward Snowden operation is a perfect example of the Marxist tactic called the 'Scissors Strategy'. Marxists utilize the tactic of employing false oppositions, more commonly referred to by Marxists as the Scissors Strategy, in which the blades  represent the two falsely opposed sides that converge on the confused  victims, neutralizing true opposition to socialism, thereby allowing the  advancement of socialism to the bewilderment of the true opposition.  The Snowden operation was mounted by the Marxist co-opted political  establishment in the West in order to produce an unfavorable image of  the United States and the West in the eyes of the world, thereby  bringing into being the Marxist grand objective of ‘convergence’ between  Europe and the 'former' USSR (with China joining, after the fraudulent  collapse of the Marxist regime in Beijing*), a union meant to replace  the European Union after its manufactured collapse, thereby isolating  the United States both politically and economically:  Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and Soviet minister of foreign affairs  Eduard Shevardnadze on the upcoming new European union with Russia:  ""Editor's Note: The phrases 'From the Atlantic to the Urals', 'From the Atlantic  to Vladivostok' and 'From Vancouver to Vladivostok' are interchangeable  in the strategists' lexicon. In the course of his Nobel Peace Prize  Lecture, delivered in Oslo in June 1992, Gorbachev said: 'Our [sic]  vision of the European space from the Atlantic to the Urals is not that  of a closed system. Since it includes the Soviet Union [sic], which  reaches to the shores of the Pacific, it goes beyond nominal  geographical boundaries'. Note that Gorbachev, who had been out of  office for six months, referred to the Soviet Union, not Russia. In an  interview on Moscow Television on 19 November 1991, Eduard Shevardnadze  continued speaking as though he was still Soviet Foreign Minister: 'I  think that the idea of a Common European Home, the building of a united  Europe, and I would like to underline today, of great Europe, the  building of Great Europe, great, united Europe, from the Atlantic to the  Urals, from the Atlantic to Vladivostok, including all our territory,  most probably a European-Asian space, this project is inevitable. I am  sure that we will come to building a united military space as well. To  say more precisely: we will build a united Europe, whose security will  be based on the principles of collective security. Precisely, collective  security'. These statements by key implementers of the strategy reflect  the central strategic objective of asserting 'irreversible'  Russian/Soviet hegemony over Eurasia, thus establishing the primary  geographical component of the intended World Government.""   Comrade Gorbachev [in 1992], meet Vladimir Putin [in 2012]…  “Russia is an inalienable and organic part of Greater Europe and European  civilization. Our citizens think of themselves as Europeans. We are by  no means indifferent to developments in united Europe...That is why  Russia proposes moving toward the creation of a common economic and  human space from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean - a community  referred by Russian experts to as 'the Union of Europe,' which will  strengthen Russia's potential and position in its economic pivot toward  the ""new Asia.   For article citations, see my blog...  https://sites.google.com/site/deanjackson60/home  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- * “Since at least the early 1970s, the Communist party of China has been poised  to create a spectacular but controlled “democratization” at any  appropriate time. The party had by then spent two decades consolidating  its power, building a network of informants and agents that permeate  every aspect of Chinese life, both in the cities and in the countryside.  Government control is now so complete that it will not be seriously  disturbed by free speech and democratic elections; power can now be  exerted through the all-pervasive but largely invisible infrastructure  of control. A transition to an apparently new system, using dialectical  tactics, is now starting to occur.”   ...and...  “A campaign for a new system of World Government will be launched at  Summit level and will be accompanied by pressure from below, the active  use of agents of influence and secret assassinations of leaders who are  seen as obstacles. The campaign will come as a surprise to the US  Administration. In the ensuing negotiations, the US President of the day  will find himself facing a combined pressure from the Russians and the  Chinese. The Chinese will by then have adopted a ‘reformed’,  pseudo-democratic system.”",0,1,Dean Jackson,9KyltHXrxVk,0.11903615991851284,2016-09-15 02:32:52,False,True
