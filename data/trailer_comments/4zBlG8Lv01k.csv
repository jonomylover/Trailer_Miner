2015-02-14T12:26:37,hopefully this isnt as disappointing as dont be afraid of the dark. for all the hype around del toro as a horror director... he hasnt really made a good one yet. hes better suited for fantasy and action. whenever he tries to scare me... it either comes across as childish or only works for a short period of time and then gets blown by some upcoming childish shit. i feel like this will end up being aimed at teen/young adult girls who want to see loki seduce a woman. it will probably having some really bad twist ending that makes any creepy moments leading up to that point pretty much meaningless and ineffective when you watch the film back. of course this is an assumption but im just basing it off what ive personally experienced with del toros work. id rather see hellboy 3,1,1,Gunso Big,4zBlG8Lv01k,-0.05499999999999999,2015-02-14 12:26:37,True,True

2015-02-16T13:35:43,"This is one of those movies I'll only see because of a certain actor, namely Tom Hiddleston. But hopefully I'll end up enjoying the movie in and of itself, like ""Only Lovers Left Alive"". I am, however, worried about two things. One, I feel this teaser trailer is playing into Tom's current popularity and is showcasing him as the most prominent character while in fact, if I'm not mistaken, Charlie Hunnam is first credited and he has the leading role. So I suspect the end product might have less Tom than this suggests. Secondly, taking that into account, I'm afraid to say I don't think Charlie Hunnam can match his co-stars in terms of acting chops, so it might be a little painful to watch. ",2,0,Lisa Joanna,4zBlG8Lv01k,0.02563244047619047,2015-02-16 13:35:43,True,True

Whatever this is, it'll have sparked your creative side, and it will be something you're quite proud to reveal. It may have something to do with the entertainment industry, or it might put you in the spotlight among your colleagues. You'll know with absolute certainty that you're not meant to fit in -- you're meant to stand out. Mercury Retrograde ends February 11, allowing you to make progress on a top-secret communications-related project you've been working on. It may take until the New Moon on the February 18 before it really gains traction, but know that this endeavor has everything it takes to succeed. Why? You have simply put so much careful thought, editing and planning into it. All of those hours behind the scenes will begin to pay off. Money flows after February 19, but so will expenses, so be sure to exercise patience and prudence when it comes to your budget. Hasty decisions about your finances might cost you more than you think, so take a step back and consider your options carefully before you fritter away any of your hard-earned cash. The good news is that after February 20 and until March 17, you'll have extraordinary support to help you make more money. Remember: Don't waste it!

Just there are house in the middle of no where all the time, being in town could have mmm interesting twists.  The Lady in Black worked well, but the lady in Black2 failed.  I want to see this movie, just hope all m concerns are squashed by the end of the movie.... mmm a haunted music directed and written by del toro... what a nutty idea, I would see it LOL",0,0,Kentershaw pcm,4zBlG8Lv01k,0.19523809523809527,2015-04-12 04:31:37,True,True
