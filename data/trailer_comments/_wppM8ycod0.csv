And I know that a boatload of people out there that are willing to come to this movies defense, arguing that you can't judge an entire movie based on a one minute trailer. Well let me ask you this, was Oz the Great and Powerful a good movie? No. Was the Alice in Wonderland reboot a good movie? No. Will Maleficent be a good movie? Probably not. When Disney allows itself to expand on new stories and adventures to tell it's avid fan-base instead of recycling the same CGI garbage over and over again they are able to entertain, dazzle, and take viewers breath away. It's really disappoints me to see Disney continue to sell out like this by making cheap, live-action garbage just to fill seats, and if it doesn't end soon, then the future of live-action Disney films foresees a weary existence.

2014-05-16T02:50:12,if Disney was to ACTUALLY follow the original telling of this story BOTH the step mother and two wicked step sisters would die in the end of the story. the step mother falls to her death trying to stop Cinderella from escaping through a window on the third floor of their home. while the step sisters both have there eyes pecked out by a flock of crows. the fairy god mother is actually a demon sent to find those that have been the most wicked and inhumane. while looking for such creatures she finds Cinderella and offers to rid her of her strife. Cinderella agrees to this if and only if she can have a peaceful and fulfilling life once all is said and done.  ,0,0,were wiccawolf,_wppM8ycod0,0.032499999999999994,2014-05-16 02:50:12,True,True

The plot set up for this film seems similar to the animated one, but they give more details and go into the back story of why things are the way they are in Cinderella's life. It could be an excellent retelling or a mediocre one. Either way I am excited for a full trailer so long as Disney doesn't shift their entire focus to live action again and completely ditch their animation department. .   I personally want a film that tells the back story of Ursula, as it is implied that Ursula and King Triton are siblings.

Keen to support her loving father, Ella welcomes her new stepmother Lady Tremaine and her daughters Anastasia and Drizella into the family home. But, when Ella's father suddenly and unexpectedly passes away, she finds herself at the mercy of a jealous and cruel new family. Finally relegated to nothing more than a servant girl covered in ashes, and spitefully renamed Cinderella, Ella could easily begin to lose hope. Yet, despite the cruelty inflicted upon her, Ella is determined to honor her mother's dying words and to ""have courage and be kind."" She will not give in to despair nor despise those who abuse her. And then there is the dashing stranger she meets in the woods. Unaware that he is really a prince, not merely an employee at the Palace, Ella finally feels she has met a kindred soul. It appears as if her fortunes may be about to change when the Palace sends out an open invitation for all maidens to attend a ball, raising Ella's hopes of once again encountering the charming ""Kit."" Alas, her stepmother forbids her to attend and callously rips apart her dress. But, as in all good fairy tales, help is at hand as a kindly beggar woman steps forward and, armed with a pumpkin and a few mice, changes Cinderella's life forever.",0,0,Abbey Bominable,_wppM8ycod0,0.11765480895915677,2014-05-16 05:08:02,True,True

I dont think they are trying to replicate frozen i think they are doing what Maleficent is but from the same angle of the original story.  I can't help but think it will fall on its face. Maleficent/Sleeping beauty is a story we all knew and loved told from another perspective, were gaining information on this one learning the 'how and why' of one of the most amazing villians ever.  With Cinderella its the same story but live action.  I can't say that is going to pull the attention of kids, or even muster the attention of an adult considering there have been 8000 remakes already.  As i said before, it doesn't seem like there is anything to be gained from this video, I don't feel hungry to watch it as much as other movies. Personally Mulan or Ariel would have been a better choice then watching a girl get her heart broken by abusive siblings before dawning an obnoxiously sky blue get up.  But knowing Disney and its many many many spectacular films, anything they set hands to will make an impressive amount of coin.

But could it be possible to choose to make a rendition of a story or film that NEEDS a rendition. The classic Walt Disney Animated Feature of Cinderella is one of his strongest movies and has aged remarkably well. It's unnecessary, Make a movie rendition of a less Disney movie that had great potential but fell flat do to technical difficulties or being beyond it's time or of a movie with outdated film conventions that wouldn't connect as easily with a casual modern audience. From the late 90's on you've been on this streak of botching an master artist with sequels and live-action reiterations of his work. Your almost as bad as the majority of internet fanfictioneers.

The noblewoman, after giving birth to her daughter, orders one of her servants to seek out the charcoal woman and if she has a baby boy, to kill it.

I mean, yeah, Tangled, Brave, and Frozen are all fantastic, but let's face it; after being bombarded for the past decade with Shrek sequel after Shrek sequel after Shrek sequel, and (in all fairness) the baby boom of Disney princess movies over the last five years, the animated fairytale seems to be somewhat over used, don't you think?    I haven't seen Maleficent yet (obviously) but from what I've seen in the trailers, I'm liking the dark twist Disney is giving their classics as live action films. And if you want to add some darkness, live action is probably the best way to go. (i.e. Once Upon A Time. You think people would've taken that show seriously if it were animated?) I'm sure Maleficent is the first in a long line of Disney live action reboots, which doesn't have to be bad, I mean it is DISNEY after all, and aside from the dark ages, and that insulting Pixar spin off (which, for the love of Hans Christian Andersen, do NOT ask me to name) Disney has never really let us down. Now, I know I can't really judge from this 1 minute fly around of Elsa's...sorry...Cinderella's shoe if it's going to have a dark twist like Maleficent, but if it does, shut up and take my money, Disney!

I'm pretty sure the director and producers know what the fuck they are doing, and probably not gonna go with the 1950s version of singing mice and animal. For all we know they might go with a darker side of the story, where an orphan girl is treated like shit by her step mother, maybe there will be more to the story. What if the step mother married Cinderellas father for his money and fortune and then she killed him, making her Cinderellas legal guardian. What if this movie will be about a girl trapped in a house treated like slave, and some magical wish or something helps her to escape her house.

It's not racist, it's just her character. To change her skin color to any other color whether it be black, brown, white, or blue would be racist; period. Anyone who claims that her skin color is not racist; is a racist. While, anyone who does claim her skin color to be racist; is a racist. You can see where this is going. Bottom line, if you want an 'X' color Cinerella (white, black, brown, blue) the only way it will work is if you write the story yourself where she starts out 'X' color.

It's all dark and horrible in my opinion, and I doubt many teenage boys etc. are going to pay to see a Disney film because apparently it has death in it and a witch with wings (wut? XD). Anyway, I'm sure many people will agree that the MODERN Disney non-animated films aren't too ""Disney"" but I guess that's my thoughts. I'm not saying that Disney can't turn all Marvel and Scream and stuff because I don't DIRECT Disney (though it would, admittedly, be fun).

I think this movie might be good.  Already the cast gives me reason to hope.  it stars Lily Allen and James Madden, stars of the immensely popular Downton Abbey and Game of Thrones, as well as this year's Oscar winner for best actress, Kate Blanchett, and another Oscar winner in Helena Bonham-Carter, though it might simpy be a case of nepotism since her husband Kenneth Branagh is the director.  That's the only thing that worries me, because I wasn't a huge fan of his last couple of movies, but maybe he'll get this one right.   I enjoyed Thor.   Have a little hope, people, and just wait and see what happens.  I think this will be a great family movie and tell a wonderful story so I'm looking forward to it.  Have a nice day everyone, and please, try and be a little kinder towards each other.  It's only a movie!!!  Feel free to go out and make one so we can critique it if you feel up to it!! ",0,0,Mark Kingsford,_wppM8ycod0,0.22149671316337982,2014-05-18 05:04:40,True,True

That is a thief of Cinderella's heart(since he has everything else) but turns out to be a complete douche bag by the half way point or end of the movie (like Eugine, Hans,  and King Stefan.) Or 3.

I just saw Maleficent the other day and fell in love with it. It truly impressed me. And honestly, there (to me) seems to be a cycle of a remake that is bad or simply decent (usually the first) and then a very good one (in Disney made movies). I think we should give Disney a chance to prove themselves a good movie company once again. They've fallen into a pit, but seem to be getting better. I am looking forward to their future movies. I've been disappointed these past two years, since Brave came out. Now things might be getting better, like Frozen (and I'm not saying Frozen was perfect, it's just much better than what I've been seeing from Disney). Big Hero 6 looks really good to me.

My generation at least had sequels to remind us that there are great animated features out there, but these generation don't have nothing coming out to remind them of the classics. So I think it's great that they are doing Alice In Wonderland, Maleficent & now this, because they draw the focus back on the main thing that made Disney famous in the first place, but with a twist.  Also, Do I need to remind you that Disney has made ALOT of live action versions of their original properties?

2015-03-03T11:20:50,"I'm not sure if this is mere coincidence. Yet, this year many (thousands) of Americans will get 2 see 2 versions of Cinderella.  I just saw Rogers and Hamerstein's Cinderella a few days ago at the Paramount in Seattle. I do like the idea of adding Jean-Michel who is a student revolutionary who is against the injustice that prince Topher ' s kingdom has been evicting the poor. It adds a little politics to a fairy tale.i also liked that it was a masked ball--very Shakespearean.  And guess what? We have another version coming in a couple weeks: this one. I just thought it odd that the Rogers And Hamerstein version that was on Broadway a couple years ago had the same logo as the Disney one. Though, the broadway one has a little more pink in the background.   I wonder if Disney will add in Jean-Michell. Probably not.   Wouldn't Be weird if Disney and Rogers and Hamerstein both had their versions of Cinderella on Broadway At The Same time? That would be really confusing.  Now it just may be ignorance, but this movie is not Rogers and Hamerstein version with Disney just being the production company?  I don't think it is. But if it was, that would be an awesome marketing strategy.   Has anyone seen the updated Rogers and Hamerstein's version this year? Apparently,  it went through some changes according to the fans.
