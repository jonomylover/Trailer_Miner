2017-08-01T05:56:57,"This film misses the point of the book ENTIRELY! It was a character study of a family headed by 2 people who were night and day with the sides of their characters (When they were good, they were great; When they were bad, they were wicked), and a daughter coming to terms with hating the way her parents acted/act while still loving them. I don't see the laziness or spoiled nature of the mother and I don't see the dark, semi-tamed, evil of the father. I don't see this movie including Charlene(and her importance to the story of the father), Erma (and her importance to the story of the father), Grandma Smith (and her contrast to her daughter). I don't see the dark R-rated stuff, which can be portrayed in a PG-manner, that happened to the kids being shown. e.g. Rex pimped his young teen daughter out, and only her john's distaste for her body, mixed with her clumsy ingenuity, saved her; Her father even laughed when she tried to get him to beat up the guy.The straight up invented¬†dialogue has me very worried, especially since Walls' tone and the words her characters used were perfect. (""Take that back! Take that back or by God I swear I'll... ¬†""What are you going to do to punish me? Not take me to bars, anymore?"" )This was not a story about a girl being embarrassed about her poor, hipster, parents; Please let this trailer be a major marketing mislead used to get butts in seats because the chart says downer movies don't sell.",0,0,MollyAnnMissie,bdNiNhSeSDk,0.07556818181818183,2017-08-01 05:56:57,True,True

The book was subtle with how it portrays the struggles of the family and the protagonist's changing reactions to her parents' idea of life, further associating those traits to her parents as a whole. The movie, judging from reviews and trailers, seems to be very, very loud both literally and thematically, with half the trailer sporting Brie Larson shouting, exposing why everything is wrong and how her parents are dumb. While those ideas were in the book, they were conveyed smartly through inference, character development, and the structure of events that developed the ultimate meaning of the book.  This film seems to have been made, I mean designed by a computer algorithm, to be Oscar Bait. The prestigious actors, the one-hit wonder director, the fact that based on a true story, and the writing that's trying way too hard to mean something but instead comes across as obvious, and the fact that everything is so shiny and bright, unlike the book, where the characters and environments broke down and degraded over time as the struggles within the Walls intensified.

2018-02-03T07:43:30,I read the book years ago and its still one of my all time favorites. I was skeptical about how it would be portrayed on film as many as you are and with good reason. The book was dark and twisted and sometimes seemed hopeless. But also there was adventure and laughter and such a raw look into this families life that was amazing to read. In my opinion I thought the movie hit all the notes. Watching the movie felt like seeing Jeanettes family come to life. The music and the way it was filmed I feel matched what I pictured while reading the book. Yes there was a few scenes that were not included in the film but that is to be expected. But I feel that the movie truly did the The Glass Castle justice and i would recommend the movie to everyone. It had me angry and laughing and crying just like the book did and thats the goal right?,2,0,Erica Reynolds,bdNiNhSeSDk,-0.02269653423499577,2018-02-03 07:43:30,False,False
