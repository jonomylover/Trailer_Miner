Any troll that disagrees has never embraced the essence of the game. 47 may have been the product of genetic engineering, but he was no super soldier. He's just one out of a dispensable clone army, an expendable asset with a psychological anomaly, the ability to question and reason. He has no amplified or enhanced physical attributes, in fact he is just as vulnerable as any individual save for his high tolerance for pain thanks to modified sensory endings. Like any soldier he had to be trained in the arts of war, weapon mastery, toxicology, espionage and counter intelligence, escape and evasion tactics, and of course shadow warfare. His methods have always been low tech, often exploiting the environment to set up the mark, sometimes procuring household items as improvised weapons. There was no question all his tactics required some degree of stealth, and his options were always one of two, death from a distance, or up close and personal.

Agent 47 is a legendary assassin. He plans his hits before and strikes from the shadow (or uses disguise). He never involves in a mass shootout in broad daylight. But you are making him a COD character in the movies. 2. He has no emotions or weaknesses for any particular gender or age. He does not give two shits about a 'damsel in distress'. 3. He is a cold blooded murderer. If situation demands then 47 will kill unhesitatingly an innocent eyewitness to protect his cover. 4. Somehow 47 is not an atheist. He has a strong belief over God. If you can imply this concept into the script successfully, then go for it. Otherwise don't bother about it. Its not mandatory. 5. 47 Never-Never-Ever falls in any kind of human relationship other than the mutual killing business contract.  Yes, he is that bad guy after whom John McClane or Bruce Wayne would go. He is the anti-hero. 47 is 'The Jackal'. Now make him like that. Believe me the movie will be a massive hit.

Mission impossible (can't remember which one) they portrayed the romance (even tho they just met and the relationship is purely physical) well where it doesn't mess with the story.

The Hitman games don’t really have much straight up action in them. You get rewarded for killing as few people as possible. You constantly need to change outfits, make things look like accidents, and almost everything takes a lot of time. They could have actually made a whole trilogy of movies, starting with a solid one that is more accurate, and with the good reception, people would be up for higher stakes and more action in the next. This one could have been a really good trilogy closer, because it is huge and action packed, and it doesn’t really warrant a sequel.",0,0,Benjamin Long,Pv7lgQ8hiz0,0.21458333333333335,2018-02-04 18:01:45,False,False
