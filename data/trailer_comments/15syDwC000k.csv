My biggest problem, and it happens all the time in movies and books, is that the protagonist shouldn't have to be reminded of his/her love for the love interest by another character. If I'm to believe that the two are to live happily ever after and that the correct decision was made, the decision should be on the character alone and uninfluenced by anybody else. Her decision ended up feeling like a product of her environment and not just her following her heart. Don't get me wrong, she chose who I felt she should have chosen, but the circumstances around it just killed the authenticity of it.

Despite her home sickness , she meets a man and falls in love but the lure of going back home threatens to scupper the relationship.  Brooklyn is real old fashioned love story that could quite easily have been made in the 40's or 50's.  Saoirse Ronan is brilliant and is turning into a very accomplished actress . There is also a very good cameo from Julie Walters who plays the very funny Mrs. Kehoe .  Some critics have gushed over this film , I don't quite see that myself but none the less it was quite enjoyable.",0,0,redvalleyjohn,15syDwC000k,0.2927746212121212,2015-12-31 10:36:15,False,True

Sorry I can't root for a wh... cough cough. I just can't. Showing people crying and announcing bad events does not make drama. I was like ""why should I give a shit"" all the time. One good example of such attempt done right is The Diary. It gets us into all of the main characters' personal little problems too, yet we care. Ellis looks incredibly lovable at first, but that quick and easy transition to being with a second guy and all, just missed me. It started like she came back for her mom, and then she just realises how nice orgasms are and goes after them. To me, the movie has a very foul depiction of women. Unless that's what they want to tell us, that there are no good girls.

I hate this and other movies where the guys on top and the sex last like 30 seconds.  This is not realistic and doesn't happen in real life.  Now some people can be in the heat of the moment and the sex can be great but there has to be a mental work up and touching before it occurs.  I also thought it was weird that they still had their clothes on.  Oh and they get married the next day and am like thinking couldn't they have waited until the next day and made it more romantic?

What I loved most about the story is that it brings home why everyone should move to a foreign country - even if for a while - as it grows you as a human being.  because it is not a Hollywood film there is zero jingoism with no transgender Chinese baker at the end reciting the Gettysburg Address.
