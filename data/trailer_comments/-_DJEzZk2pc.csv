The tone and scope of the film is going to be unbelievable. My personal opinion is that it will be incomparable to The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger‚Äôs performance is incredible and cannot go unspoken, the character will undergo many alterations over time and his portrayal of the character will not be forgotten. I cannot wait for the Joker film and what it will bring to the expansion of the already amazing icon. Joaquin is an amazing actor and he will do a great job, judging from what has already been shown. How he is shown in the trailer will only be a glimpse of the Clown Prince of Gotham and I hope the film will deliver on the insanity and brutality I believe it should deliver.",0,0,Harry Johnson,-_DJEzZk2pc,0.35192307692307695,2019-04-04 03:28:16,True,True

2019-04-04T04:45:50,"For those confused why Bruce Wayne is a little kid during this Jokers rise, heres my theory.   In the trailer, you see multiple people wearing clown masks in the riot & the subway scene! This implies that the JOKER will create chaotic events that unknowingly ""inspire"" people in GOTHAM & a future person with similar mental issues/experiences that will take up the JOKER mantle. ESPECIALLY IF IN THE FUTURE A BATMAN FIGURE ARISE! Almost symbolically challenging someone to step up & be the JOKER.    Its similar to the GOTHAM tv show, where when the Jerome becomes the Joker, he inspires crazies even after his incarnation/death.  I feel that even though this is a stand alone film, it will give us some sort of idea that any DCEU Joker we see involved with, for example, The Justice League, it will be implied that the JOKER they face will have been inspired by Joaquin's joker.

Dark Knight took him in a direction where his own clothing and makeup was really grotesque and disheveled, like he'd been living in a sewer for years.  It was an interesting take and I don't have anything against, but it was following the trend most movies do when they try to ground the costumes of superheros and villains in a more ""realistic"" way.  Of course, ""realistic"" usually just means darker, drabber and less ostentatious.  Here, once he's all dressed up, he just *stands out* against the backdrop of everything else, and seems completely alien to the environment in a really unnerving way.  Solid, bright colors, clean lines.  When I first saw that old test video they released I thought it looked awful and silly, but now I think it's amazing.

2019-04-06T01:21:25,and my personal opinion I don't know what to say I mean maybe for delusional weird strange people this movie maybe some kind of cult classic but I just wonder when are they going to realize the Joker is not a regular guy if you follow the comics at all you don't have to understand the Joker fights against Batman Batman fought against Superman The Joker Is Not a mere mortal he's really a bad motherfuker and until they put that on film DC's universe is going to continue to crumble they want to make it seem like oh he's a regular man and whatever the storyline is the Joker fights against Batman he's not a regular guy The Joker is a semi superhero he's not fully a superhero but he's definitely not a mortal man why can't somebody just do the movie according to the way the comics depict him people don't want to see regular people on screen they want to see semi Gods on Scream because that's what we like in the endgame look what you have superheroes people that can do things the mere mortals can't anyways figure it out or bring somebody in that can,0,0,ktlewis42,-_DJEzZk2pc,-0.07470238095238095,2019-04-06 01:21:25,True,True

Joker is a bad ass, his girlfriend, Harley, another bad ass. His make up, childish. His suit, Salvation Army. My Joker doesn‚Äôt wear two dollar suits. My joker wear crazys fricken make up, not mister Rogers clown impersonation make up. Yes we all know the origin story ‚ÄúOrigin‚Äù Mr. President, not oranges. Joker was a poor comic, he made a wrong decision out of desperation and shit went sideways and falling into the chemicals, but, the joker, comes out of the tank a criminal mastermind taking down scores that easily buys him Armani suits and yeah, CrAzY. Joaquin Phoenix makes the Joker look like Napoleon Dynamite as a grandpa. Yes, I‚Äôm going to see it, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a movie about my fav character!‚Äù But, I‚Äôm not liking anything I‚Äôve seen in this trailer...wee, ya got the iconic staircase from the movie the Exorcist, cool. Rolls eyes. This movie is super focused on showing how much effort the actor put into loosing weight for the roll and maybe he finally shaved off that Virginian mountain man beard, but they overkill that aspect. I don‚Äôt care to see his pathetic self dancing with his mommy. I don‚Äôt wish to see him dancing in front of a mirror in his dirty fruit of the looms. He looks more like a skinny John Wayne Gacy, than he does the Joker. Batman‚Äôs nemesis, the Joker. The one villain who always is a handful for Bats. Y‚Äôall took that joker and turned him into a piss smelling, crack smoking, subway riding mumbling to himself in the corner and he apparently did some horrible deed in the movie. Can we just make a deal, let‚Äôs give him the Oscar for smoking crack to loose weight for the roll, but, we all will simply just watch The Dark Night instead and while I‚Äôm bitching...Jared Leto, your desperate attempt to seem crazy, was just that...desperate.

2019-04-06T15:09:28,"This is why Batman is my favorite comic/cartoon since childhood. His rogues gallery has some of the most memorable and iconic ones of all time.  There are some that even outdo that Dark knight himself, and that's saying something.  There's not only the Joker but Two-face,  Penguin, Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, The Riddler, Ra's al Ghul and the League of Assassins,  Scarecrow, Bane, Catwoman, Harley Quinn, and Clayface just off the top of my head. Each one of them can spawn their own movies. It's nuts that the whole Batman universe is so vibrant and entertaining.    Not only that, but as an avid gamer, Batman's Arkham series is arguably the best superhero video game I've ever had the pleasure of playing. I really hope this movie succeeds, particularly because Joaquin Phoenix is seemingly giving his own take of the Joker instead of trying to outdo previous actors who took on the role.

2019-04-07T01:30:04,"Ok, lot of ignorance in the comments, so I'll correct a bit of it. 1. The Joker has had many origin stories told, a large number by the character himself. 2. The Killing Joke was NOT the first one, is NOT a comic book, IS a one off graphic novel, and originally NOT intended to be cannon. Most DC fans can't ignore it's suspicious release year of 1988 being do close to the release of Batman, starring Jack Nicholson as the Joker with a very similar origin.  3. The Joker's first origin story came in 1951 in Batman Vol. 1. 11 years after his debut in Batman #1, published in 1940. (He was the man behind the Red Hood). 4. What makes Joker so iconic is his insane unrelatable personality. He's the villain we don't quite understand, and can't really sympathize with. We also don't know where the fuck he came from (he already existed under the Red Hood). The character himself can't even get his own origin story straight.  Basically, this might be a good movie, but you twits saying it's more like the comics than any other joker are full of shit. This Joker, judging from the trailer, is the least like the comics....

Plus Joaquin Phoenix is a solid actor, he's definitely got the charisma for the character. And as far as comic book characters go they don't really have to worry as much about character or story continuity with Joker, his character and origin are so mercurial over the years that any fresh, entertaining depiction of him gains kudos from Batman fans. Nicholson, Hamill and Ledger are all pretty beloved for their portrayals in part because they are all quite different from each other yet still really engaging to watch.    So I've got some faith in Phoenix here. My only concern is that DC movies almost always have a good cast, it's the direction and writing where their movies sometimes fall flat.

Seriously - if you're going to choose a prestigious and accomplished actor who has a reputation for being FUCKING INSANE, you could not do much better than Joaquin Phoenix.  Does anyone else remember that he applied such a tremendous degree of commitment and reality to the film ""I'm Still Here"", which was a slightly overbaked (in the stoner sense) post-modern comment on the corrosive effect of media and pop culture, that people were legitimately concerned about his mental health and well-being.  I think that speaks volumes, to a degree.  I really can't think of many actors who would be better than Phoenix - he's definitely the best choice of anyone who is 40 or older.  Looking at younger actors, the only one who TRULY pops out as being able to do that role is Adam Driver - he's the kind of guy who could really rip his teeth into a role like that.

He wasn't created by society, he fell into a batch of chemicals which screwed up his brain. He was pretty normal before that happened. Every rendition of the Joker pre 2000's has put this into light. The real debate is whether he was a gangster before the chemical accident but the idea that society created him is a bunch of bs and was never in the original comics. Tho I will say that the OG comics going back to the 30's never gave him a true back story. So it's tough and debatable. I like the chemical idea more than the whole society thing.

The Joker has been around for 90 years and we never learned his name. This is about as exciting as finding out how Han Solo got his name. I know some will point at the Killing Joke and some other ""origins"" (all of which are terrible and ruin the character). Sorry, but Alan Moore is Alan Moore. His work is amazing, but it's always non-canon because...Alan Moore. The man earned the right to take on these ideas, not these vampires that are still trying to squeeze blood out of the corpse of Heath Ledge over a decade later.   Why is Bruce Wayne a kid? The Joker is almost always roughly the same age as Batman, not what appears to be 30 years his senior. This tends to be the case because Batman created the Joker, except now he didn't? And apparently when The Batman arrives 15 years later the Joker will be an old man? What? Did ANYONE consider that their best villian will be in his 60s when doing battle with Batman now?   Why is Joker created by society? Every Batman fan alive knows that without Batman, the Joker doesn't exist. He exist because Batman exists. This was done masterfully in The Dark Knight Returns when after Batman retired the Joker didn't say a word for decades and then, while watching the news and seeing Batman has returned, a big smirk cracks across his face. But sure, society created The Joker...mind blown.   Anyway, enjoy ruining another cherished DC character.

2019-04-08T07:38:51,Don‚Äôt know why people are doing comparisons to HL joker. They‚Äôre completely different and that‚Äôs obvious from this trailer. This joker is showing how his perception of life is challenged by the real world and that‚Äôs what ‚Äúsends him insane‚Äù. The scary thing about this joker is we don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs thinking until it‚Äôs revealed by the characters actions. Like others have also said this is going to be a much darker and sinister version of the joker and the movie is going to be moving towards more of a thriller. Ledgers joker was his own and a very talented portrayal of the joker but was another antagonist for batman to fight and his moments were gold but few and far between (in a way). I guess the only way for me to be able to describe what I‚Äôm thinking is that JFs joker is going to be a twisted sinister IT type and HLs joker was a twisted criminal/don.,0,0,david bell,-_DJEzZk2pc,-0.040588235294117654,2019-04-08 07:38:51,True,True

It was actually the dad that mainly supported him. Further ruined when they make out he beat up a hardened black gang with guns - he would be dead in a second even if he did manage to beat them.

Joker may be an insane bastard, but he always really wants to make a statement or make people see his messed up form of humor. In a sense, he just wants to be understood, in many scenarios he was in. He hardly ever succeeds, all while other dudes in costumes get all the appreciation, because after all, what he does is hated by people who aren't like him.

In the beginning the LORD God, our heavenly Father, breathed into us life and blessed us with His laws, that we may be His precious and holy people! But we have disobeyed the LORD and brought sin into the world! Because we have sinned, mankind has been cursed with death! Our holy Father hates sin and He will punish all who have sinned against Him! Since the beginning we have been rebellious to the LORD and followed our own evil lusts. Humanity became more and more evil, refusing to obey the LORD and walk in His righteousness! All of humanity have sinned against Him and deserve to die! No one is good or righteous! No one can justify themselves! Every person on earth deserved to die and to suffer eternal damnation!   But the LORD God had mercy on us all! Though we are sinners and stubborn at heart, the our heavenly Father provided forgiveness and salvation! God loved us so much that He sent His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, to die for our sins! Jesus Christ was the only man without sin; for this reason He was worthy to take away our sins with His own blood! The Lord Jesus Christ suffered shame, was beaten, spat upon, brutally tortured, bleeding all over, and died on the cross! But He was resurrected three days later! He is alive right now, and God has given Him power and dominion over all things! Jesus Christ gave up His own life to save us from the wrath of God, and the blood He shed for us cleanses away all sin from us! Because of Him we can be forgiven of our sinful ways and be reconciled back to God! Jesus Christ holds the gift of eternal life, and He shall grant it to all who believe in Him and repent of their sins!   Repent, believe and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and bare good fruit of the Holy Spirit! Repent of fornication, idolatry, adultery, homosexuality, transgenderism, masturbation, pornography, murder, wrath, strife, stealing, drunkenness, lying, witchcraft, yoga, sorcery, drug abuse, sedition, extortion, envy, arrogance, heresies, revellings, revilings, weed smoking, cussing, lasciviousness, hatred, emulations, variance, and unbelief! God revealed His mercy to us through His only Son, and we can break free from these abominations through the blood and Spirit of Jesus Christ!   But those who reject the mercy of God and remain in their sins shall be denied everlasting life! The sinner shall die in his sins and be thrown into hell! They shall weep bitterly and gnash with their teeth in unbearable pain! The Lord Jesus Christ will pull them out of hell to face His judgement, and he shall be condemned! The sinner shall be cast into the lake of fire and suffer the second death!   Only those who are born again can escape eternal damnation! Those who have believed in Jesus Christ, repented of their sins and have been baptized in His name shall be saved! On the day of judgement Jesus Christ will grant them eternal life in the kingdom of God, and there they shall rest in eternal paradise! But you must be born again to receive this gift! No religion will save you! Catholicism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, any religion will lead you to hellfire! Only the true word of God can save you from condemnation, and the second death! Jesus Christ is the only way to be saved; repent, believe and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and be saved! Jesus Christ is returning soon to judge this evil world and only those who are born again and endure to the end shall be saved!",0,1,Josue Gonzalez,-_DJEzZk2pc,0.14971139971139968,2019-04-09 16:48:11,True,True

""Some people just want to watch the world burn."" This is what happens when you denigrate and destroy a human beings will to live. People should learn from this movie. Great premise. The only way in which the Joker and Batman differ is that Batman chose to stay in the Dark to uphold justice and the light and to try and improve the society whereas the Joker chose the Light and Happiness to tear down the frail fabric of society, trying to expose them for who they are and let them ""eat eachother."" They are quite literally the inverse of each other. You'll notice that all three villains in the Christopher Nolan Trilogy were actually moral anomalies, trying to save the world from cancerous civilizations and Batman stood in their way because he believed people could be saved. Neither was necessarily wrong, just different perspectives on what they perceived to be the problem of society to be and how correct it. Batman thinks he can use intimidation and fear and prison to correct peoples behavior, The joker believed everyone is part of the jungle and thought it was funny how ""animals"" pretend to live in society, the league of shadows predominately oversaw the existence of civilizations to keep in check governments that can become corrupt.",0,0,Benjamin Balisky,-_DJEzZk2pc,-0.006862099253403598,2019-04-10 01:15:22,True,True

The most prosperous, most powerful nation ever to exist...and the joke is on us. Because although we claim to be the ""greatest"", we sit atop the wrong end of the most shameful lists: mental health, violence, incarceration & recidivism, economic inequality, anxiety/stress/depression, suicide, cancer, heart disease, obesity.  The Joker is a perfect symbol for what we're becoming. The human mind is fragile yet adaptable. Easily warped and dangerous when pushed past its limits...and the only option is anomie. Withdrawal from society, from empathy and the recognition of intrinsic human value... and acceptance of cold, sadistic animosity as the only practical defense mechanism.   This could be brilliant. It seems to say, there are no evil men. Only the application of rational conclusions, based on rational responses to an abusive, degrading, apathetic environment. There is only nature. That is the tragedy/comedy of it all. We learn to abuse each other, as we are perceived as only means to each other's ends. It's a fucking game.

He's a flat character: a character that doesn't change, but changes the world around him. He's evil, he's chaos, period. That's just who he is. No need for a motivation that makes us feel sympathetic towards him, no need for a reasonable explanation about why he became that.  I know this may sound surprising these days, given that most recent villains are sympathetic (Killmonger and Thanos, to name two) and flat, unsympathetic villains have been a failure (Steppenwolf, Ares, Doomsday), but sometimes they work! And the Joker is a prime example of that. I'm not sure I'm OK with turning him into someone with a name and a reason for being what he is.

2019-04-12T18:35:22,"Before going into this trailer, please make sure that you watch it with a fresh set of eyes. If you try watching it by keeping in mind the Heath Ledger's version or the one in the DC Comics, then you will miss out the nuances of this gem.This whole teaser trailer gives the vibe of the movie Taxi Driver. The small congested apartment, the narrow hallways and the environment around him.Thorough out this teaser trailer, you could see that Arthur laughs to get through his circumstances. He is using laughter as a coping mechanism. The scene where he is in the almost empty train and laughing lifelessly, appears to be a continuation of some misfortune and it seems as if he is trying to get through it by just laughing. Also, the most powerful moment for me in the whole trailer, is the scene where he forces himself to smile even though his eyes are brimming with tears. That scene is so plapable, one could feel his sadness when that single tear drop falls from his right eye. It just breaks my heart everytime I watch this trailer.And who could miss the song that has been so aptly used in this trailer. The one used here is by Nat King Cole (originally sung by Jimmy Durante and written by Charlie Chaplin) perfectly captures the above emotion. If you could read the lyrics, you could see how poignant it is. It gives a life to this trailer and makes one see how Arthur is trying to embody this in his life across all the misfortunes that are happening to him.You could also see how the people around him treat him. When he is smiling and holding the placard in front of some shop and simply doing his job, it is the children who assault him. The Children!!! And in the train, you could see that it is the people in the suit who mistreat him for no apparent reason. One can see that it is the filth (people) around him, who destroy him completely.All in all I can say that it is a heart breaking trailer, which shows us that there are people around us who go through a lot and how the acts of cruelty done intentionally or unintentionally could derail them completely.And remember ‚ÄúAll it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive",0,2,Pau D.,-_DJEzZk2pc,0.14155844155844158,2019-04-12 18:35:22,True,True

August 11th, 2019 (Acts 7:6-7, H.R. 1242) God is coming for His Kingdom and may he have mercy on the unknowing but deceived ones. They are making noise and it will only get worse. Prepare, find peace in your hearts and act when needed, till then, remain at peace.  We are all Israel. (God‚Äôs people) The only truth that matters is in God, the Commandments, and the Laws in which he told us to live by. Do not be concerned of worldly things. God told us these things. It is a simple truth. The worldly truths may only spread fear, and God does not want us to fear worldly things, it is like a virus for those being told these worldly truths that don‚Äôt believe in God. We are the ‚ÄúAgent Smith‚Äôs‚Äù of this world. They are then consumed by maybe fear, or ignorance and steered away even further from the real truth that isn‚Äôt worldly by introducing them to this hell of truths in this world. It may only damn their souls. God hurts in these moments. Love and peace to you all. Remember, the only truth that should matter is in God. Spread Love, not hell. Their downfall will come. They are only making noise but it will only get worse. Prepare. God bless you all and remain at peace. Do not be an asset in dividing humanity. They are making America the world‚Äôs enemy. Look into ‚ÄúThe Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion‚Äù, all the truth is in it, all their intentions. Seek the knowledge then turn away from feeding them your energy once you have the truth that you need. This is the foolish work of Knight Templars > Freemasons > Zionists.

2019-06-05T04:45:59,You know I don‚Äôt think they should make this movie because the reason why we like the joker is because he is strange and the reason why it is a great character because we don‚Äôt know what his backstory is . And that‚Äôs why we like the joker like we know his farther was a bad parent by beating up the joker and he fell into a pit of acid and that is what changes him into the joker but there are pokes at his original backstory and making him a pleasant person doesn‚Äôt make the story better it actually makes it suck because in one of the Batman movies he is a criminal and the Batman follows him into a area and the Batman try‚Äôs to save him but he is already in the pot of acid and that is the joker we know and love so making this movie is probably not a good idea especially if they are going to tell us the full backstory for the joker,0,0,grimtaco 910,-_DJEzZk2pc,0.14652777777777778,2019-06-05 04:45:59,True,True

2019-08-04T05:38:26,As a die hard batman fan i am going to skip this movie its nothing like the original joker. The gotham tv show thoroughly botched the batman storyline but that can be chalked to the multiverse scapegoat that dc is known for. This on the other hand is nothing more than trying to reinvent an already perfect character. Joker is an unknown person and all that is ever really known is that he had a pregnant wife he had no job and he was desperate for money when he got dressed as red hood and later turned into joker by accident. He wasn't a clown before hand and this makeup which looks nothing like joker is just a piggyback design cause it chapter 2 is coming out so thwy just trying to push the scary clown image. Joker is by all accounts perfect as a character as a villain and has the best origin one could ask for for a villain. I will not waste any time watching this in theaters or on home video. People need to leave well enough alone before it ends up being another fiasco like the MCU let happen by letting Disney get their hands on it. There should be people well versed in the comics that they make movie adaptations of especially long standing famous characters. It is a big fuck you to the fans when we have to listen to people spout off nonsense they think is canon because they saw it in a movie. So lets put it out the infinity war is way off base spiderman far from home is bull**** mysterio has always been a spiderman villain never an ally. There was no guardians of the galaxy during the infinity war. Hela is loki's daughter and loki is thor's brother. So if you want the infity gauntlet story read thanos quest 1&2 to see how he got the stones its a better story and then read infinity gauntlet to see how it should've went. As far as joker read the killing joke to learn what has been revealed about joker and his past. Sorry for the rant but I can't keep quiet about bad comic movies any longer thanks for reading my comment.,0,0,Nunya Business,-_DJEzZk2pc,0.05972222222222224,2019-08-04 05:38:26,True,True

Nobody can do the comics justice. But none of this is stating that I disliked any Joker, movie, or the actors talent; it's very much the opposite. I love all of it. Especially the animated ones since they could do well with his look. But Idk, it's not that I care about appearance or whatever for shallow reasons, I just always see him as the skinny long faced crazy bug eyed huge mouthed tall guy because it suits him best and that's how he was when I was introduced and really nobody has that look.

Yet from green hair to purple suit, from Arkham Hospital to Bruce Wayne and Thomas Wayne - everything references the Joker in the comics we know. So it's really about giving the Joker a kind of real world but very liberal spin and trying to show how the character came to be and could elicit our sympathy. Todd and Phoenix sure go through verbose lengths obscuring all that. Just call it what it is. And then let the audience judge. I think most would see the movie as something of one's descent into desperation and madness. But without Batman in it?

I'm sorry but I feel like not knowing anything about the Jokers past is part of what makes him the villian he is. The movie is trying to give some sort of humanity to him or give a reason to feel sorry for him, no. The Joker is the bringer of chaos, doesn't matter which version you watch. I personally prefer the psychotic bronze age joker, which Heath Ledger portrayed, followed very closely by the golden age, which Jack Nicholson portrayed. All that to say, stop trying to give criminals sympathy points. Oh this mass murder was bullied so that gives him an excuse for his actions. You know what an excuse is? A skin of a reason stuffed with a lie. Let the great comic book villian just be a comic book villian.

If they do, they were too far gone before the film. That's like saying kids start smoking because a camel in sunglasses tells them to. If anything, this film draws much-needed attention to the deplorable lack of interest or knowledge, at least in America, about mental disorders. This film is no darker than what reality can be. The violence is no worse than the average R-rated film from the late 1980s. It is a perfect film, worthy of recognition alongside The Godfather, Casablanca, Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's List.

The portrayal of the human psyche into sheer madness due to childhood trauma was well paced. Very little to no CGI which was very welcomed.

2019-10-08T12:26:11,"""TAWA"" JOKER  Beberapa jam usai nonton pilem ini, tawa Arthur Fleck alias JOKER terngiang-ngiang, tragis dan paradoks di telingaku!  Musik yg menyayat dan akting ciamik Joaquin Phoenix menjadikan tawa JOKER terasa menyeramkan.  JOKER sebagaimana BATMAN, musuh bebuyutannya, adalah produk ""sakit"" sistem sosial di Gotham City dari dua kutub berbeda, yg satu kita sebut PENJAHAT PSIKOPAT yg satu SUPERHERO.  Keduanya ternyata punya kesamaan, sama sama ""Tidak Bahagia"" dan ""kesepian"" dan sama sama merasakan suasana paradoks dan anomie buah dari sistem sosial yg sakit.  Sistem sosial  yang sakit oleh  sosiolog dan psikolog kritis Erich Fromm disebut PATOLOGI SOSIAL dan berdampak pada  dehumanisasi yg di level individual sering menyebabkan HOPELESS (Kehilangan harapan).  JOKER yg sejak kecil dicekoki ""virus"" bahagia oleh ibunya dg panggilan HAPPY ternyata tak pernah bahagia semenitpun, sistem sosial tempat dia hidup tak bisa menerima kehadirannya, menyakitinya,membuatnya menderita, padahal dia hanya ingin menghibur orang orang dg bercita cita jadi pelawak dan badut.   Namun sistem sosial justru menempatkan dirinya menjadi ""sampah"".Kondisi Hopeless kian menjadi ketika dia dipecat sbagai badut, satu satunya harapan dia utk mendapatkan mimpinya ( KEBAHAGIAAN), membuat orang lain terus tertawa, mengetahui bahwa dia adalah anak pungut yg berkali kali hampir terbunuh dari ibu angkat yg juga sakit jiwa, tak diakui oleh ayahnya yg juga belum jelas kebenarannya, sampai diundang mnjadi tamu oleh pelawak pujaannya justru oleh rekaman video lawakannya yang tidak dianggap lucu!  Kondisi Hopeless menjadikan  Arthur mendekonstruksi PELAWAK/JOKER yg jadi impiannya, lelucon yg bagi orang lain tak lucu, sebagai balasan atas apa yg dialaminya, MEMBUNUH sambil tertawa!!!  BATMAN yg antitesa nya JOKER dalam berbagai sequel juga murung, karena kelamnya masa lalu,melihat ayah ibunya dibunuh didepan mata oleh seorang bertopeng badut, harta berlimpah yg justru membuat banyak orang menjadi pembencinya, di sisi lain petugasa keamanan tak bisa berbuat banyak menghadapi penjahat, maka BRUCE WAYNEpun memakai topeng, ""melanggar hukum"" untuk melawan penjahat.  Maka keduanya adalah pelanggar hukum di dunia nya masing masing, dunia penjahat dan dunia pahlawan.Dan keduanya sama sama gagal sbagai individu, TIDAK BAHAGIA!  Sistem sosial seperti yg diungkapkan sosiolog Talcott Parsons memang punya sifat equilibrium/keeraturan yg justru membuat orang permisif dg kemiskinan, kejahatan, ketidakadilan, kebohongan, bahkan kebiadaban.Sebab hal itu adalah fungsional, saling melengkapi dan dibutuhkan oleh sistem.  Ideologi equilibrium itulah yg menjadikan dehumanisasi dalam sistem sosial yaitu kembiarkan KEKALAHAN, KEJATUHAN,KEMATIAN, KEBIADABAN, KEBOBROKAN, KORUPSI,KEMISKINAN,KEBODOHAN sebagai keniscayaan, dan kewajaran pula ketika kita diam ketika orang lain yg berada di posisi KALAH, atau bahkan merayakan dengan suka cita.  JOKER dan BATMAN adalah produk dari Gotham City yg sakit dan selalu ditampilkan GELAP penuh Distorsi dalam setiap sequel Batman dan telanjang dalam film JOKER yg baru pertama kali diceritakan utuh.   Semoga TAWA JOKER yg horor dibalut musik satiris itu hanya menjadi hantu di ruang fantasi kita saja......",1,0,nyalabeningjingga,-_DJEzZk2pc,0.5,2019-10-08 12:26:11,False,True

It really was quite shocking once you get to the climax of the movie. I just took a step back and it hit me how powerful it was. Most films dont have that effect on people. Some movies are not meant to have a happy ending, some movies serve to just show you one person's situation and life, even if that life is agonizing and miserable. Phoenix did such a great job with the character too.

2019-10-24T13:39:21,"Ok here is a story if you're interested about why this movie hitted me so hard.  I'm a young, shy and unsure adult that is 19 years old. I have Epilepsy anf Autism Asperges.   The beginning years from my birth to my elementary school years, I was nothing but a stranger. The weakest child in class always tired, exausted and distracted by my Epilepsy. Teachers treated me like I was a problem. Kept the smart and social kids away from me. Outcasted me to the corner, I frequently played by myself with my toys I had to bring from home. I was often alone. I had no friends. And when I finally got friends almost all of them abbandoned me as soon as they founded out that I had Epilepsy diagnoses. At times nobody knew that I had Autism Asperges...  I was 5 years old when doctors, teachers, parents and even friends told my parents that I am weak, that I'm never gonna be able to live on my own, to work for my own, to love, to have a family, that I woudn't even be able to establish friendships....I was gonna be a problem....they never said it this way but they damn well sended it over to not only me but my parents....  Worst part of it all was that while i was being born a young doctor in college opperated on me and screwed me up by not cleaning my lounges. I sufficated and brain damage was done. So not only they took my chances of becoming intelligent they are very likely the reason I am who I am to this day.  The night before doctors often told my parents that i could be the smartest son they yet created. I have 2 smart brothers both high IQ. Both got high degree from college. But me? I was gonna be the smartest! Doctors kept talking of how smart i could become even my IQ could be between 120/136. They took that from me.   Then from the age of 10 I was forced to leave my one and only bestfriend who loved and accepted me for who I am to go to this ""Special High School"" where I got bullied so badly that my parents and the school principal were onces again forced to drop me out from there and putted me on a different special school where i got bullied even worse and experienced multiple beat up attempts. I got in a depression and I started to see myself as a problem, an object, a mistake in a succesful family. This went from my 10th to my 16th when I finally got out of my depression and had a greatfriend to talk with.   I'm now studying on a more mature special job school where there are adults. I met there a sweetgirl who now became my bestfriend. She means the world to me. I see her as my soulmate as my sister I see her as the most precious thing life ever throwed at me. She aslo cares so much about me and she even makes time and always puts her problems aside to just hear me out and to help me. I would take a bullet for her any day any time.    I'm not asking for pityness. All I've been asking is that I wanted to be treated the same and to this day. I frequently have the feeling that my parents don't listen to me. You know where you're being putted in society when people say things like; You don't understand cause of your Autism. You can't come with us cause of your Epilepsy. You can't negotiate with us. You're Autistic! From the beginning I told myself that I could be normal. That I could be part of society and everyone laughed me same as the Joker but now? I don't want to have anything with society anymore. They made me not carring. Now I focus on my closest 2 friends who treat me as a equal and respect me. and on family of what's left of it.. thank you for your attention.",6,3,iFabianXD,-_DJEzZk2pc,0.1311409494460342,2019-10-24 13:39:21,False,True

Hard-working good honest (91% MEN) people continue to slave for a speices that doesn't give a fuck about them, i see that EVERYDAY, good souls broken EVERYDAY until they snap and then say good-fucking-bye to the people you love. If you ever notice almost if not all serial killers or any, they don't see that they committed any crime because they have  ""released"" the majoritys subconscious desires. A crime is a crime but what if the world cared and about the wierd and different before that, but the majority wouldn't do that, they don't care and they want the monster. Really think about it. It makes me super sad and angry to see ""monsters"" finally snapping and get shuned and no one cared about them in the first place.
