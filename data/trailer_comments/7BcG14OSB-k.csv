I didn't know that piece would actual be about discrimination and race, I thought it was just a cute, well animated movie. It didn't show its entire plot in the trailer. We all know we have seen this type of story before: a protagonist has his future planned out for him, but he wants to do something else, so he leaves his home to follow his dreams...you get the idea. I can honestly predict this entire movie in my head - it's the same situation with Sing.   Besides the plot, this film is so lazily animated - it resembles Norm of the North, appearance wise. It's definitely not the WORST animation I have seen, but you can tell that the people behind this movie didn't try their best on the scenery. Perhaps they were on a budget cut - who knows?  Not only that, but the jokes I am observing in this trailer are so predictable and over-used....if you want comic relief, don't use moments that have been used for years - make your own ORIGINAL humor.
