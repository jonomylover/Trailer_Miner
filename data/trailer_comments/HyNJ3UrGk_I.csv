WHY DO THEY DO IT?? - We have absolutely flawless shots of incredible action sequences and then when it gets to two people stood talking on a sidewalk, the camera is clearly being hand-held. Even for the idiots who still believe that this adds tension to a shot - this shot wasn't supposed to have any tension. It was just a general conversation. So I rest my case... They clearly ""rushed"" this shot to save time and money and for me, it would make me think twice about seeing the film again.    You'd think if they'd put so much hard work into the rest of the film by keeping every other shot rock solid - the last thing the Director would want to do would be to chuck a couple of rushed shots in. - I'm speechless! - Still, monumental and 1000% better than anything Greengrass could ever cobble together!",0,0,PMiddy001,HyNJ3UrGk_I,0.14250000000000002,2018-11-24 23:37:09,False,False

It ruined the pace of what would have been a A+ marking on a much anticipated sequel as far as I'm concerned. I felt it should have been more interest in the character development of the antagonist. I did like how the bad guys were once soldiers themselves,apart of the same individuals who the bad guys are after but their actions just wasn't in depth,didn't leave me feeling like they deserve the consequences of their actions because not being flushed out a bit more as far as ALL of the wrong doers instead of just one being briefly described for their premeditated actions. What I did enjoy,the action sequences,very brutal and a step up from the previous film plus we received more!! I liked the sub plots,just the character miles could have been taken out because there was no need and it effected the pace. The plot I also got a kick out of,just needed more flushing out as far as a more intriguing motive with character development that way I really would have been cheering to see the bad guy get his just due. It was there,just not executed properly. All in all,a good sequel but not superior to it's original because of I didn't have the same issues as I did with the equalizer 2. I also want to add the cinematography and location scouting was full of eye candy& I admired how the third act action sequence took place in a evacuated town,bombarded by a hurricane,where McCall once inhabited.",0,0,mancave THEATER,HyNJ3UrGk_I,0.1254166666666667,2019-01-05 13:44:30,False,False
