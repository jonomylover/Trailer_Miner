Roald Dahl is one of the best children's authors there has ever been. I read many of his stories and I can recall a while back an animated movie of The BFG was made and David Jason played the BFG. But these days with technology so much better and with so much more on offer with regards CGI and other things¬†this looks like a great movie again. Spielberg has brought a classic children's story back to life and it looks like it will be a great family movie. 2016 will have many¬†movies¬†like this such as the new Jungle Book that has been brilliantly brought to life.,0,0,shanemental,GZ0Bey4YUGI,0.4041498316498317,2016-04-06 17:05:30,True,True

Anyone who read The Big Friendly Giant remembers how she was taken. No cat, no book, just a gap in the curtain and the moon. And that was only the beginning. This entire film is begging to get ranted at.   Disney, you've done it now. You've ruined one of Roald Dahl greatest books and turned into this CGI, sparkly, colorful.... thing.   They are making the title ""The BFG"" dirty. None of the things that happened in the trailer happened in the book. The entire thing is made up, original. That itself would have been nice, had they not used Sophie's name, or tried to make that person-thingy replace the BFG. They could have at least included the queen in the trailer, assuming that they put her in.  Also, where are all the jars that The BFG keeps the dreams in? Where is his net? I can see his trumpet, but where is the net used to catch the dreams? Why the flip are the dreams glowing?  The book readers know that only The BFG can catch them because he can hear them. In the scene where Bloodbottler comes to see if The BFG has Sophie, why do all the giants come? Where is the whizzpopping? And the snozzcumbers?  I'm very sad.

2016-07-03T23:45:17,"Epic visuals as usual for a Stephen Spielberg; but, I can't say I'm too excited to see the film. I personally have always had a problem with most children's books and TV shows being adapted to newer movies... All of the Doctor Seuss movies, The wind in the willows, Smurfs; all of them were crap compared to what I remembered as a kid... Sure, we all look for nostalgia, but if your looking to appeal to an older crowed who is familiar with such stories, it helps to stay original as possible. Overall, I believe these newer movies deteriorate the true clean enjoyment that most of us adults experienced as children. In reality, its just Directors and Writers looking to bum off another story from an older source just to continue making cash from the idea; of course, all while bending and changing the story as they please in hopes of appealing to a new younger generation.  Btw, I'm not saying that all film adaptations are terrible; I rather enjoyed Jim Carry's The Grinch, but then again I hated his version of the Christmas Carrol... compared to the actual story, the movie was just deliberately weird in some spots in attempts to be considered 'different'. My question is, how much more different do we need to create these stories before they are indeed no longer the same story? Sadly, 9 times out of 10, The answer seems to be as simple as making the decision to create a film adaptation in the first place. Depending on the simplicity of the story, I think Spielberg should have known that this movie had flop potential... it not like it was Harry Potter, which was an easily yet phenomenally successful movie adaptation with lots of content to explore and expound on; but IMO, with his experience he should've known this movie couldn't really go anywhere with popularity; especially when you consider the primary crowed will probably be the very adults who may have read the original book as a child.... I mean come on; children of today will never read the book; and once they watch the movie, (even if they liked it) the story will have officially been ruined for them..That is the reality.  Btw; what kids truly like to read anymore, especially cute children's stories which don't involve adult content?... That, is the reason why these directors get away with ruining what at times could be a great production... too many parents are watching Game of Thrones with their kids for them to be truly interested in something sweet.",0,0,Hiram Abiff,GZ0Bey4YUGI,0.1551439393939394,2016-07-03 23:45:17,False,True

The first hour doesn't seem to have a direction. First hour is literally just pointless bickering and development of friendship with no direction really. It felt like I was there for 3hrs.  Then when they finally got the plot moving, it turned into another hour long feeling of some more development we already saw the first hour. Then it moved again and the climax was so underwhelming.
