2018-05-05T04:18:09,"I love just about anything to do with US War Between the States, especially from a Southern perspective.  I read Thomas Cullinan's excellent book, ""The Beguiled"" many years ago and thought it fantastic - I've still got my copy tucked away on a dusty shelf somewhere.  I was delighted when the original movie with Clint Eastwood as John McBurney was made; however he was badly miscast in the role (Colin Farrell in  the 2017 version is so much better)  and overall I didn't enjoy the film as much as I'd hoped, largely because the book is so good, and glaring inaccuracies in character portrayal of the women.  Forward to 2017, and Sofia's atmospheric remake appears.  Closer to Cullinan's storyline, but still with some noticeable inaccuracies.  Where the hell is Mattie, the Afro/American slave girl?  She is an absolutely pivotal character in the book as the story is told from her point of view a lot of the time; she also 'gets' what is going on and the effects McBurney will and does have on the ladies in Farnsworth's Seminary (is her omission another example of out of control political correctness?).  The thing that annoys me most about both films is character portrayal.  The two teachers are sisters:  Miss Martha (the head) and Miss Harriet Farnsworth.  The girls are:  Miss Amelia Dabney, (the 'child of nature' who discovers McBurney ) Miss Marie Devereaux (the brat), Miss Alicia Simms (the tart), and Miss Edwina Morrow (child of a slave owner and one of his slave girls), and of course, Miss Mattie.  Although both films aren't bad, they could be so much better.  I'd like to see a remake that STICKS TO THE BLOODY BOOK!",0,0,QueenKatz8,_r_FSRbuZ9Y,0.18214285714285716,2018-05-05 04:18:09,False,False
