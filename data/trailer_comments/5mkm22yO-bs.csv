2015-09-16T00:54:00,"Interesting...  I'm not the biggest fan of _The Jungle Book_ mostly just because I'm unfamiliar with the story and it's one of the many Disney films I haven't seen, but this looks and feels more like what I think the original story was like; grittier and such.  As such, it could be interesting, and I would't mind seeing it in theaters.  However, I'm stuck on how they're going to fit in ""The Bare Necessities"", as goofy and lighthearted as that scene was.  I mean, throwing it in at the end of this trailer just seemed really out of place.   Another thing that came to mind: this is a story set in India, yet none of the voice actors are Indian.  And sure, it's a fantasy story with talking animals and at least the actor playing the only human character fits the role (plus the voice actors they did get are each really good in their own right), but still, there's always something a little off to me when what are supposed to be stories set in real locations have characters talking like a non-indigenous human culture.  Same could be said for at least some of Disney's older films that are based or rooted in non-European cultures like _Aladdin_ or _The Lion King_.  As far as I know, the former failed in that regard and the latter, as much as I love the film as a whole, only does marginally better.        Also, side thought: I'm more interested in this film itself as a potential precursor to a live-action _The Lion King_.",0,0,Poppy Raima,5mkm22yO-bs,0.18722651222651224,2015-09-16 00:54:00,True,True

I have never seen anything to compare to it.  While this looks like it will have the usual technical skill that Disney studios puts out, their bastardization of original text makes me very leery.  What they did with the animated version of The Jungle Book was a mockery of the amazing, deep and very misanthropic story of Kipling's.  The book is not a cheerful child's look at the natural world, but a vision of mankind at it's most venal, and the honesty (and brutality) of the animals in nature.

So, what would you call that thing that happens at the end of this trailer where in an ""after credits"" type of scene, they give us a glimpse of Baloo whistling the classic *""Bare Necessities""* song? I'm not asking for you to describe it (i.e. floating on a river, etc), I'm saying, what is that type of moment called? Please, seriously think about it, I'd like to know. Is there a word for it? It's obviously instantly recognizable to us, and if you're like me, you thought, ""omg...they included that song, that's really, really cool!""   So what's that called? You might say, ""well, I’m not quite sure what you’re asking, and why this Youtube comment is so weird and long, but this is obviously a scene where the they included that classic song,"" or ""they're kind of redoing something from the past.""  Well, first off, I said ""_word_,"" not a sentence to describe that moment :). The best I can come up with are words like, *""homage,"" ""callback,"" or ""tribute.""* If you wanna stretch it, maybe even ""reference."" The problem with those words are, it doesn't quite have the right connotation. At all. Not even a little bit. *It's completely lifeless and devoid of the actual emotional reaction we get when seeing such scenes.*   Here's what I mean. It's not as if we would use any of those words and say, *""oh cool, they paid homage to that song,"" or ""haha, nice callback.""* No, in watching that scene, as that tune played, *you probably smiled to yourself, while others who are huge fans may have hunched forward towards their monitors and put their hands to their open mouths, eyes wide with joy and surprise. While even bigger fans may have pushed their feet on the floor to scoot backwards in their office/gaming chairs. Finally, people that saw this in groups, most likely smiled giddily and looked around to silently say, “please tell me you recognized that song!”*  Whatever the degree of reaction, there's an emotional content there. And again, to describe these moments of *nostalgia*, all we really have is our own emotional reactions for to describe it (just look at the comments that reference the end of this trailer, all of them say something to the effect of, “was that song what I thought it was?” and “wow they included the song.”).  There’s no single word that I know of, and there should be. We have a lot of words to choose from to communicate thoughts and Ideas. To be as granular and precise as we want, to spin our intentions just the way we want, to put the exact, tiniest connotation on an idea to make our points. But not here. They didn’t think of a word to describe this type of moment, but they’re going to have to.

Well, Mowgli helps Baloo get a shitload of honeycombs later on -- until he is stolen by monkeys that take him to King Louis, who wants him to create fire (the red flower) ... KING LOUIS is pretty goddamn menacing, especially when he gets his fat ass up and starts rampaging after Mowgli (after Baloo and Bagheera's distraction). Blah blah blah, Mowgli eventually steals a torch from the man village and runs back to face Shere Khan -- along the way, the boy starts a brushfire throughout the jungle, which sets the stage for the showdown....Blah blah blah, Shere Khan falls into the fire. Mowgli beats his dick to celebrate!!!",1,0,Hellzyead,5mkm22yO-bs,0.07058823529411766,2016-04-12 08:09:02,False,True

2016-04-30T08:36:56,"Mowgli is a ""man cub"" raised by the Indian wolf Raksha and her pack, led by Akela, ever since he was brought to them as a baby by the black panther Bagheera within the jungles of Seoni, Madhya Pradesh. Bagheera trains Mowgli to learn the ways of the wolves, but the boy faces certain challenges and falls behind his wolf siblings, and Akela berates him for using human tricks like building tools instead of learning the ways of the pack.  One day, during the dry season, the jungle animals gather to drink water that remains as part of a truce called during a drought that enables the jungle's wildlife to drink without fear of being eaten by larger, more predatory beasts. The truce is disrupted, however, when a scarred Bengal tiger, Shere Khan, arrives, detecting Mowgli's scent in the crowd. Resentful against man for scarring him, he issues a warning that he will kill Mowgli at the end of the drought. As the wolf pack debates whether they should keep Mowgli or not, Mowgli voluntarily decides to leave the jungle for the safety of his pack. Bagheera agrees with the decision and volunteers to guide him to the nearby man village.  En route, Shere Khan ambushes them and injures Bagheera, but Mowgli manages to escape. Later, Mowgli meets Kaa, an enormous Indian python, who hypnotizes him. While under Kaa's hypnosis, Mowgli sees a vision of his father being mauled while protecting him from Shere Khan. The vision also warns of the destructive power of the ""red flower"". Kaa then attempts to devour Mowgli, but he is rescued by a sloth bear named Baloo. Together, they form a close bond after realizing their teamwork allows them to get honey easily for Baloo, and Mowgli agrees to stay with Baloo until the winter season arrives. Meanwhile, Shere Khan confronts the wolf pack, but upon learning Mowgli has left the jungle, he kills Akela and takes over the hills to lure Mowgli out.  Bagheera eventually finds them and is angered by Mowgli's usage of tricks to get Baloo his honey. An argument flares between Mowgli and Bagheera, but Baloo calms them down and persuades both of them to sleep on it. During the night, Mowgli finds the herd of elephants gathered around a ditch, and uses his vines to save a baby elephant from the ditch. Although Baloo and Bagheera are both impressed, Baloo realizes he cannot guarantee Mowgli's safety after Bagheera tells him that Shere Khan is hunting for Mowgli. Baloo agrees to push Mowgli away in an effort to get him to continue onward to the man village.  However, Mowgli is kidnapped by the Bandar-log who present him to their leader, a humongous Bornean orangutan-like Gigantopithecus named King Louie. Assuming that all humans can summon the red flower, King Louie offers Mowgli protection from Shere Khan in exchange for the red flower. Baloo distracts Louie while Bagheera tries to sneak out with Mowgli, but their plan is discovered. As Louie chases Mowgli though his temple, he informs Mowgli of Akela's death. His rampage eventually causes his temple to crumble on top of him. Furious that Baloo and Bagheera never told him about Akela's death, Mowgli goes to confront Shere Khan alone.  Finding the man village, Mowgli steals a lit torch to use as a weapon and heads back to the jungle, accidentally starting a wildfire in the process. He confronts Shere Khan, who points out that Mowgli has made himself the enemy of the jungle by causing the wildfire. Mowgli throws the torch into the water, giving Shere Khan the advantage. Baloo, Bagheera, and the wolf pack intervene and hold Shere Khan off, giving Mowgli enough time to set a trap. He lures Shere Khan up a tree and onto a branch, which breaks under the tiger's weight, and the tiger falls to his death into the fire below.  In the aftermath, Raksha becomes the new alpha of the wolf pack. Mowgli decides to utilize his equipment and tricks for his own use, having found his true home and calling with his wolf family, Baloo, and Bagheera.",0,0,Mohammed Huzaifa,5mkm22yO-bs,0.05696763553906411,2016-04-30 08:36:56,False,True

2016-06-07T08:53:15,"Impressive CGI in this movie, and amazingly realistic animals in it. Nonetheless two comments regarding Bagueera (my favorite character by far, and the reason that drove me to go and watch the movie):  - first of all, as some people may know, ""black panthers"" do not exist as such, as a kind of feline like lions, tigers, cougars and so on are. Right now I cannot remember whether Kipling himself described Bagueera as a ""black panther"" in his novel, but this term (used in a way as broad as vague and imprecise) actually covers melanic leopards and jaguars. Wrongly done. Melanic leopards and jaguars (which are not the same, of course) are darker than the standard specimens, and they may seem ""black"", but when light hits their fur perpendicularly, you can still see the dots on their fur. That´s why the Disney cartoon Bagueera (and this CGI one apparently too) seem to have a uniform fur. Wrong again. Shame that they seem to have failed in this little detail about Bagueera in this movie...  Furthermore, there are a number of big cats whose scientific names start with ""Panthera"": Panthera leo (lion), Panthera tigris (tiger), Panthera pardus (leopard), Panthera onca (jaguar)... and probably some more that I cannot remember now.  - Kiplin´s novel (and all the movies inspired by it) are set in India, so Bagueera is NOT a ""black panther"", but a black or melanic Indian leopard; a Sri Lankan (melanic) leopard, maybe, which is smaller than the African leopard.   Leaving Bagheera a bit aside, King Louie and his obsession with learning on making fire just puts on my nerves: he seems to know well enough that Mowgli was raised in the jungle, among animals, and that he seldom had any contact with other human beings. Why did he even bother then to capture the kid? Useless kidnap. Or is it because he believes that been human carries genetically the skill and instinct on knowing how to make fire?...

While I like how Sher-Kaan has a backstory was cool, I felt he didn't have the same intimidating charisma he did in the original. Mowgli and Baloo also didn't have the same chemistry as in the original, where Baloo started consulting and guiding him before they officially became friends. But Bill Murray was still a lot of fun, Ben Kingsley as Bagera was spot-on and making King Louie a giant mob boss played by Christopher Walken was an epic choice.

2016-11-11T21:26:54,"I almost always appreciate the movies i watch, but this has to be the worst movie I have seen in atleast two years. Like are you freaking kidding me, the wolf leader gets killed and the 10 wolves just stand there and growl after they just literally witnessed their leader getting killed, even though they learn the ""one for all all for one"" wolf pack code till they remember it and repeat it every day. That's just so bs on so many different levels. AND THEN GUESS WHAT, everyone hears about it and nobody does anything? The tiger is literally sleeping where they live, they could kill him while he sleeps? And well, i won't even get started with the wolves living in the jungle, a young child having the muscle capacity to somehow grab a buffalo's horn so his arms don't break or he doesn't instantaneously lose his grip, there being a drought in the tropical rainforest climate, a small child having any chance of outrunning a tiger, a single little spark lighting up the whole rainforest in a minute, orangutan the size of a full grown elephant, a boa with hypnotic powers, a little child knowing how to do complicated knots and making his own magical rope and so so on. In the King Orangutan's palace, the panther and bear are stopped by few meters of ruins that started landsliding so it scared the panther and the bear off, but they just few moments ago climbed almost a vertical over 500 feet long hillside? And then in the end scenario they basically gather up on the side of Mowgli like they were all gonna defend him, but then as the tiger attacks, Baloo is the only one who interferes, the 10 wolves and a panther just standing there doing literally nothing, letting tiger take them one by one? And don't even get me started on the fact that the much larger bear or a wolf pack of 10 somehow can't easily dominate over a tiger. Then the fire, that is in the forest directly horizontal/180 degrees with the river, gets distinguished by elephants rerouting the river to the right, then suddenly the fire is directly infront of the river pathway, even though it was supposed to be straight ahead and stopped advancing from far away?  And well, the slow flow rating river suddenly causes a massive flooding, but that's the only way the movie could've finished the forest fire so I won't hate on that. And oh wait, bees were making beehives without any protective outside layer or any sections for different necessities, just honeycombs hanging loosely?  So yeah, it seriously led me down with the expectations of a better movie reembodiment of ""The Jungle Book""",0,0,Joonas Maru,5mkm22yO-bs,-0.018920732045732046,2016-11-11 21:26:54,False,False
