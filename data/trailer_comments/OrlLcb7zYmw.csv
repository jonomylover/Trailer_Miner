Rap about women having kids at a young age and having the father abandon the family, and not being able to live a decent life, working two jobs, while your kids are being raised by violent video games and movies and gangster rap and getting shot, or strung out on drugs and your kids then saying, ""It has nothing to do with the violence I put into my brain 24hr a day, 7 days a week.""

I'm glad that they made a movie like this so that dark and all those mainstream rappers see the type of struggle it was to LIVE AND RAP BACK IN THE DAYS. Unlike today there is much more security that you rarely hear artist dying.

I grew up in LA during the 80's as a child at the time period this movie is based on. Witnessed first hand the environment that was the product of those times. Aside from my personal connection to the film, I also had the privilege of being an extra for one of the major concert scenes. The set was historically accurate and recreated the experience a fan of NWA would have had. The director, the cast, the production crew, and even craft services (got fed pretty good), were cool with all the extras involved. It was a very long day. 3pm-3am. Some extras left early, but I stayed the entire shoot. Ice Cube was dope for performing music in between filming. To see a post-production trailer for the movie has impressed me with the amount of detail F. Gary Gray put into this film.

I just hope its good...I was 10 when Straight Outta Compton was released and I listened to Kool Moe Dee and Run DMC...NWA was to the rap game what Nirvana ended up being to rock a couple years later: A seismic shift. If you were putting out a certain kind of music, people weren't listening to you. We can debate if that's good or bad, but what NWA did...unlike 2 Live Crew or Public Enemy, was literally CHANGE the way people went about producing and creating music within a genre. We still see Cube and Dre, but I don't think people really understand how NWA changed rap on a MAINSTREAM level...without even getting on the radio. Imagine if Taylor Swift or Sam Smith or One Direction or Iggy Azalea had to get their music out to the masses without ANY mainstream play. No radio, no Spotify, no Pandora, no iTunes...nothing. Just essentially enough curiosity about an album to drive it to platinum status. THEY DIDN'T EVEN GO ON TOUR! And they made an album that completely changed the game...forever.

Winners of an Idealism they wish to spread for a new way to govern, not only in there country, jungles, mountains, island, what ever there goal is to spread there believe all around the world. Illuminati is no longer a an organization rather then a spirit that has survive for as long as humans have existed. We must understand that one Lie changed to future of the world. That lie came from a snake's mouth but the snake was just a pupet to an idea from someone who believed he can rule the world as well as Good. This angel because that's what he was, believed he can really do something no one had ever done even god him self. He believe that he can become god and manipulate humanity. Well if his wishes were to see humanity suffer he has succseded! But I doubt that was his initial idea. Stop and think about this , imagine that you have a beautiful family a good job and everything seems to be going well but some how you loose your job and start doing small jobs to maintain that same life stile so you feel like your protecting your family, and one day you run into an opportunity to make lots and lots of money but you have to do things that will test your character, test your moral believes. Would you tell your wife or kids? Or would you just keep doing and doing and doing this thing until byou become that and you have lost your self in believing that there is nothing wrong in what you have done,aa because after all you started doing it for your family! Well that's exactly what being comsumed by means your lost by being illuminated to a way of life! When you tell your history will you tell your kids I was a great sales Man or will you say I had to kill,torture,sell drugs,abuser,drug addic. And many more bad things! I'm sure no one would say that so the point is that When you see or read a history about anything you must understand that some ok me did not survive, the story, that there is another side to it. Most times the other story becomes a mith or legend because people just laugh at it, why because they already heard the ""truth""!  One lie changed the World Find the Truth!

I grew up in a time when m'fers were blastin this out the car, thuggin it, daily fights, getting jumped, weapons, taggin, lookin down, ""what bitch"", mean mugs, stares, back of the bus/train, gangs, PARTIES PARTIES PARTIES and  GANGS EVERYWHERE from FOLSOM SAC MARIN RICH to SF OAK SJ MOD FRESNO LA and SAN D, this music inspired and was the background soundtrack, for everything crazy raw that happened in the 80s and early 90s. All of it whether good or bad, made you mentally tough. Like Fight Club, most of my generation can deal with most problems. Little lesson for the day. I know, I know, now everything is nerdy, safe and hidden behind some cutesy lookin icon and you just wanna get durty, and you want to have some cool part of our legacy.

2015-02-18T22:56:02,"Kathryn: Ashtar is really excited; wants to come and talk to us. Let's let him speak! * Ashtar: Yes, it's me, Ashtar! Kathryn realized that I was champing at the bit to talk with you all. We are all whooping and shouting on the ship - this was a hit! * First, I want to let everyone know that the passengers on Flight 370 are perfectly happy to spend time in Hollow Earth. And when they return, they will have enough story to tell. They will be interviewed on television, and all stations will want to find out where they were and how it happened. * In the event that the cigar-shaped UFO that now assigned to hover over every conflict on the planet, if not done enough impact, when the people return from Hollow Earth are they going to give everyone an earful. * Now they know all about our plans galactic, and how eager we are to end the war. They were more than happy that the idea will be the poster children for peace on earth. They asked us to please use them as a ""hostage"" to create leverage, to insist that governments around the world, not only have to deliver all their WMD, but also accept promulgating a law NESARA around the world, in every country. * Now, this may take a bit 'of confrontation and negotiation, and we had to wait a couple of days, while thousands of people, ships, helicopters, etc, from 12 or 14 different countries, scour the ocean in search of evidence that crashed - which of course will not find. They took a couple of bottles of plastic or something, and I thought this might be a test. Of course there is no evidence because there was no plane crash. We picked up the plane, as we did before, took to Hollow Earth, and all are safe and sound. It 'a shame that families suffer, and we wanted to end quickly. If any of you know someone in Malaysia or China, if you know any of the families, please get the information to them: families are safe and sound in the loving hands of the Galactic Federation of Light (GFL). They have good food and wine (even if you do not drink wine, but they have better replacements); they are well cared for and that they are having the time of their lives. And, you know, none of them has led to a pterodactyl! * There is more enthusiasm and I will give you another bit 'of information. Many had their cell phones with them, and we also have their luggage, with their adapters, and so on. We are able to leverage the networks, so eventually they will be able to send messages to their loved ones. First, though, these crews that are sure that they will find some evidence, must finish patrolling the entire Asian continent. There are stories of ""perhaps the airline turned and went throughout Malaysia"", but of course it did not. It 'very evident on the radar that our ships were just off the coast, anticipating ... we actually chose this airliner is due to the group of passengers who were there. When we captured the airliner, we were very careful. There was no damage to the airliner or the passengers or crew. Hardly heard a bump. We can pick up and carry a large airliner without problems; our ships are huge. We were disguised planes are as fit as we flew across Malaysia to position ourselves closely enough to catch the plane. It suddenly disappears from the radar. You have seen; have seen. Those radar images have been deleted, but thanks to the internet you have all now. Many have posted; so many have now that they can not remove. There is evidence. * Yes, we need a new name for our ships over UFO. We are not 'unidentified'; we are flying objects, I suppose, but we need another term. As of Federation ships? We no longer have the space, we are here at your atmosphere, even if it originated from the whole universe. Let me tell you our plan. We intend to use the ships cigar-shaped, that it was over Ukraine which was filmed and published all over the world, too. There will be the best films to come. Of course, there are trouble spots around the world that are not easy for our light workers to reach, or for film crews, either. Syria, Somalia, there are journalists more Americans there. You will notice that wherever a conflict kicks, you will see this ship, and people will start to associate any type of warmongering, every conflict and / or the withdrawal of troops, with the appearance of our ships. Already Putin is taking his troops to their barracks - a wise decision on his part. And now, if necessary, we will begin lasering some tanks or weapons - never when there's no one around, of course. There are many areas of outdoor storage, and we can only merge some tanks or weapons, and see if this hits the news. * There are a couple of pictures on the Internet shows that we have already destroyed underground storage facilities that held the weapons of types that you might not even be aware of. They are dead now, but do not see it on the news, right? It 's interesting how you can suppress this. You might think it would be that it would be big news, if you deleted a post of 600 'storage in possession of all kinds of weapons. You would think that if many were destroyed this attracts the attention of the local news. It created quite a flash! They managed to suppress that too, and they give you an idea of ​​who controls the media. Obviously we will put an end to this. We had to work around it ... you liked our intelligent use of the old Turner Network, and seems like a nice way to start. As I said in the message of Kathryn the other night, it was sort of an elbow in the ribs to Ted Turner, hoping to sign up and help get the word out. But, as you said, there is no information on his desk, or that of the people on the ground. * Let's see, where do I get to let you in on more of our information. Many have read our message and I want to fill you in a bit '. There is of course a great connection between the ship-shaped cigar and flight 370 and the introduction of the law NESARA, which will shift the entire planet to a new way of governing. We are so excited, we are out of us on this occasion. We had to get on our hands because of the new blackout. We're not ready to take over all the stations, as we promised; that is coming, though. * We wanted to make this a little 'more gradual. The capture of the flight, the announcement of the UFO, and his abilities ... you know that this story has been handed over the line and that there are now a number of military leaders who have apoplexy for being packaged in a corner. What can you do now? Dare not ignore it? They will try to do this for a while '. Have the courage to ignore an airliner that disappeared so close - there is a link, ask. Well of course there is! Now, some of them are always our infamous description of awesome weapons that is available on this ship. Of course, we never use our rays to wipe out entire villages and repopulate them - of course this is nonsense, but it sounds pretty scary, is not it, especially for the cabal, because that is exactly what they would like to be able to do . You bet they are jealous! And appreciate the power and absolute control that is possible when you have this technology. This is the way the mind works here on planet earth, because the thought of all was contaminated by the cabal, the paranoia and the way they operate in the dark, and the constant control and who is going to control what? * We do not see ourselves as control anyone. We offer our strength, the technology that we have developed over millions of years, and we offer for your protection, well-being and the good of all. We offer you to help you get your freedom. We are happy to do this, finally, for the inhabitants of the planet earth. We do this by agreement with Prime Creator and various Councils which have consulted on these things for centuries. We finally gave the green light to help out. * As you can tell, we used sparingly. Our help was subtle and suggestive, but not at anyone until now. It 's time to make it clear, and I can tell you that we had a good time writing that piece, creating to show the world what an impressive ship and what we can, and as we listen better because now all those puny little arms also secret governments of the US and the European families with their intake of strangulation on the planet for centuries ... you can bet they were experiencing shock and awe, because they produced nothing even comes close to what we have and what we take for granted, because we had this technology for eons - long enough to know that you can not keep the peace by waging war. We have no intention to intervene in a war; we've never done on planet earth. We do not intervene in your wars, or bless one side or another. Let us prove ourselves to remind people what they are doing is dangerous and unacceptable. * We have a program now that every time there is a 'duck-duck' of the planet, it does transpire that people are seeing the UFO-shaped cigar. Now there are websites on this UFO, get the information, and at the end everyone will know about it. In the next step, we are trying to create an environment where we will contact all the leaders of all countries and let them know (especially those with citizens on the floor) that we are open to negotiate with them, and that the passengers will be released when they signed the NESARA law in their country. As soon as it comes out, that will be the next challenge. We will need a little 'help in this. * As soon as the world understands that will not be returned the ""hostage"" until the law was signed into effect, people will start to chaos. Fall all over themselves to negotiate ... or drag your feet ... or agree, but do not actually sign it. We know all their tricks and put under pressure. Of course we are not taking passengers against their will, and if they want to go home, we will send them. But many are determined to stay out until the last card is signed because they are happy to be the ones that will bring peace to the world. Now they are diplomats or representatives of their countries, and if we do not get some action you hear of some of them. Have spoken out, are well spoken, are dedicated, and they really understand the importance of this project. It 'an exciting time! It 'a very exciting time! There are many levers to pull and negotiations to be organized, and there are ways of dealing with this delicate, so we do not expect any of you to go out in the mid - and **** and start talking about this in terms hysterical. We are proceeding with caution, respect to all concerned. There are real threats, but as you can tell, we wrote a letter involves a threat implied. We are saying to the world that we will no longer allow the destructiveness and bad behavior that has been the norm. * This is my update for you all. I hope you understand. I repeat it as many times as necessary: ​​we do it for the good of all, for the whole planet, and we do it with love in our hearts, because we are your brothers and sisters. We hold you in our hearts as precious. We know that you have suffered, and we want to help put an end to it. Think not that I am saying to you that we are going to take over. Not so. We are not taking more than anything or anyone. We offered our help and at any time the passengers decide they do not want to be involved in this, they will be taken home ... but we're not going to advertise this. * The world does not understand how we operate; many of you do not understand, because in our negotiations is the depth of love, respect and care for all involved. We do not make war or create division. This is why we have taken this kind of diplomacy. We do not take sides, we simply try to arrange things so that no one is hurt. Even the dark ones who have created the problems will be given the opportunity to come forward and seek help. We are happy to give. We have no intention of creating dissent. Think deeply about what we have told you and you will see how carefully thought this is. We have created the opportunity for people to come forward, be brave, bring light and join with us. We offer our help with an invitation to join us, and of course that means the final invitation to the surface for people to join the Galactic Federation of Light. You have not been a part until now; the planet was under the control of the cabal, and we are not allowed in the Federation. Now Mother Earth will be given the opportunity to join us at the end. Naturally Hollow Earth Hollow Earth and are already members, and now it is finally able to join us. * So look in your hearts when you read these messages and try to understand what we are doing. Do not assume this is a lie or a trick. I Have Not! You know that every game of strategy, and we have seen a bit 'strategy on our part, that's all. If you were a football coach, you teach them some games intricate, and this is what we did. We are on the side of Light, and our intentions are to bring peace and love that we experience in the higher dimensions. We wish you well, and love and happiness and joy. We are here to stand by your side, and bring you the glorious paradise that was promised. You have made this possible! Do not find yourself the spread on the Internet, ""Oh, that's a lie; it can not be true, because I can not believe it!"" Why can not it be true? Just because it has not happened before does not mean it is not true. It took a long time, but we are building momentum, all together - not only those of us in the higher realms or on ships, but all together have momentum. You can feel it happening. We crossed the line. There will be no more nuclear war, the destruction of the planet Earth, or the need to save everyone on the planet, because they are in danger. The plan has changed! There will be the Armageddon; that is going to be every day brighter and more fun. * So I come to reassure and encourage you, to cheer you up and help change this direction saying ""Oh, this does not match with what someone said here, and so it must be lies!"" Do not be silly. People see this from different perspectives. Look for the light and successes; look for the real change is happening, why it is happening all over the world. Note that disasters are waning. Yes, you can still see some vapor in the sky, but those are just the leftovers. People think they are creating and controlling the disease, but does not work. There will be a plague; We will not allow nuclear war. You work with us; together we are creating this. Watch, listen, be aware, and put his shoulder to the wheel. Be part of the solution, as you say! Being part of hope, not what they say, ""I am a skeptic, and I'm going to deny everything Criminal Ashtar says, and these horrible people who say there is a whole through the center of the earth!"" * Ignore these people. Do not read that stuff. Listen to your heart. Let raised. And 'everything happens! Unfortunately, you do not need a media to tell you about it. There is no support they will tell you about the news, so do not count on this. There are sources on the internet, and these channels; listen carefully. Together with the words, we send vibrations to help lift yourself. This is all about Ascension, dear. It is only to raise your vibration, and if you break down someone else, they are not raising their vibration. Join uplifting yourself; leave behind the fear and suspicion that make you doubt everything that sounds good. It is not skepticism, this is just close-minded. Look into your heart and ask: ""I'm just desperate to be negative because I have experienced this before?"" Well, it's understandable if you've been disappointed or had a hard life. I assure you, we are working hard on your behalf, and our beloved St Germain, which has been much maligned recently, he worked day and night to help. We have to have quick footwork to keep up with the cabal; that was our goal, our challenge and our triumph. * It would have been nice if everything could have happened December 21, 2012. Not all happened that day, but that was the beginning of the watershed. It 'been gaining momentum since then, this wonderful ride that will end in your Ascension. That is not an end, but the beginning of a new life. I hope I have encouraged and reassured; Hopefully, progress has been made, the surprises are just around the corner, and if you have an open mind and a sense of humor, is delighted with what we have in Serbia. Be ready laugh, cheer, celebrate and dance in the streets. There are wonderful things that are. Open your hearts and minds, and not try to understand the basis of all that you have experienced before. It will rate more interesting, complex and wonderful than you can imagine! I will now let my brother St Germain to speak with you, and God the Father as well. Mother God has transformed into 'boys for tonight. There are teachers here with us, and the power of women is rising, and we rely on the women to bring their messages to those on the ground. We have a powerful team so effective, and all of you are part of it. Salut, all; I am, Ashtar.",0,0,Angel fotonic light cosmic,OrlLcb7zYmw,0.20591835215361168,2015-02-18 22:56:02,True,True

2015-03-09T23:41:42,People can say what they want. N.W.A. paved the unknown road to hardcore rap. They got a letter from the F.B.I. stating that there song fuck the police had resulted in the killing of 76 police officers and were ordered to cease and desist. They said FUCK THE POLICE. If you really watch the story about these guys you will see that they were revolutionaries in what they did. They along with public enemy & 2 live crew tested the 1st amendment and won. They took their cases to the supreme court and won. It was a point in time that tested the constitution and the bill of rights. These guys stood up for what they believed in and stopped at nothing to achieve this goal. whether you like them or not they had a revolutionary period that helped mold the 1st amendment freedom of expression & speech. Instead of people knocking them they should be thanking them regardless if you like what they do or not. N.W.A. fought a few of many battles and won a significant battle that meant alot back in the 80's up to this present moment. Thank you N.W.A.

Biopics tend to over dramatize things sometimes, so the accuracy can be off. I doubt that Cube, although my favorite of all time, added the part of his life where he was gettin bused to Taft High School from South Central, which is like worlds away from where he lived. Truth was Cube's mom, Mrs. Jackson, was tired of Cube getting jumped and robbed because he didn't wanna join his neighborhood gang. Wonder if Dre's woman beating past will be added. I'm sure Eazy and Ren's past of runnin with the Kelly Park Crips in Compton will for sure be in there, because that's the type of stuff that sells movies. But according to the OG Tweety Bird Loc, Ren got ran off the set a long time ago, and Eazy stopped coming around his big homies when NWA blew up. Yella's story was never too compelling, just always known as the DJ who moved from LA to Riverside when the group started to go their separate ways.   I did notice that they got Suge giving somebody a beat down (the guys wearing all the red lol). That part was more than likely depicting Suge getting Dre out of his Ruthless contract.

Back in the original room, we see Eazy-E erupt into Ice Cube's asshole balls-deep and bareback, collapsing over Cube in a crack-fueled vomit spasm. With a string of bloody snot danging from his monstrously flaring nostrils and a musical twinkle in his eye, Eazy lovingly grunts into Cube's ear: ""AIDS.""

Green is the only color. NWA could have given the rise to black women if they wanted but they were too busy exploiting their own stereotypes and keeping the woman down. An entire generation of rappers followed their lead, too, and young black men have no understanding of women and don't care about them as anything but sexual vehicles, and their only attachment to family consists of Franklin, Grant, and Jackson. Rap should have led to an educational revolution, but all we ever get is the same as we ever got. Let's see if any of these star rappers want to donate their solid gold chains for the cause.

2016-01-03T02:51:09,"*Reasons for why this movie is a good movie, but shitty as a biopic.* (feel free to provide what I left out)  1. They cut out D.O.C when he wrote lyrics for some of the members, had very few scenes with him.   2. The Arabian Prince was an early member of N.W.A, but he was nowhere to be seen i the movie.   3. Vanilla Ice funded Death Row, and the movie didn't have him or said anything about that.   4. 2pac sang ""Hail Marry"", which is not true to the real shit, cause by the time that song was made Dre already left Death Row.   5. Eazy E didn't have a final conversation with Dre or Yella in reality. Instead Dre whispered something to Eazy while he was comatose, and later Eazy died.  6. Dj Yella didn't drink in real life, yet you see him drinking and getting wasted. He didn't even smoke weed at that time or have a bitch in his lap every 5 minutes.  7.Eazy never went broke IRL, he had Bone Thugs-N-Harmony by his side and had 30 million dollars, before his death.    8.The first N.W.A concert ""Fuck the police"", didn't go down like that. There were some dudes throwing firecrackers on the stage, and the N.W.A stopped the concert and bounced back to their hotel, then they were told that some sexy girls wanted to see them in the lobby, and instead they got the police, who arrested them without any trouble. NOT that shit in the movie where people throw stuff at cops and arrest the members straight after the concert!   9. Eazy E paid Dre's bail for having unpaid parking tickets for his Mazda RX7, not for disobeying an order from a cop or standing his ground.   10. Cube didn't leave N.W.A by himself, he first consulted publicist Pat Charbonnet about leaving, and then took that decision.  11. Dre was physically abusive with lots of women, and yet we don't see that in the movie. Neither Dee Barnes, MIchele, or Tairrie B was in the movie getting punched or in the movie at all!   12. J.J  Fad are not in this movie, and they were integral to the N.W.A story in reality and their album Supersonic paved the way for their male counterparts by offering a poppy alternative to the gangster rap NWA would become known for, and - by hitting #33 on the Billboard Charts - legitimized Ruthless Records with a commercially successful album, enabling Straight Outta Compton to become the hit we know it as today.   13. Da Lench Mobb was attacked by above the law, but Cube didn't beat any of them, instead he ran away with some help from King Sun. Cube couldn't scrap IRL like he did in the movie.   14.  Yo Yo, a female rapper who worked with Ice Cube after he left N.W.A., was nowhere to be found. Nor are women who worked with Dre later in his career, like Jewell and the Lady of Rage. They both contributed tremendously to the ultimate sound of the classic album The Chronic.   15. MC Ren was a big part of the group, yet he's hardly doing anything in the movie, and looks like an extra.   16. Jerry didn't break up the crew, it was Eazy along with Jerry who broke it up. None of them fools understood a shit about the music industry and contracts, so Jerry was maybe not as bad as everyone seems to think, and Eazy didn't give a shit if he got taken care of the most, while the others didn't.   17.  'The beef with dre and Eazy aint in the movie, ""A real Mothafucking G"", also ain't in it.   18. Dre got tons of kids, nothing mentioned about that shit in the movie.  19. Ice Cube wasn't the only one writing the songs for N.W.A, The D.O.C did along with Mc Ren. The movie shows Cube doing that and it ain't right!  20. Cube's family life, with middle class income wasn't portrayed in the movie. Cube wasn't poor, he had two parents, and he went to phoenix institute of technology, earning a 2 year degree in architectural drafting. Far from gangsta. Not in the movie also!  21. Also Dre, Cube, and MC Ren didn't show up for his funeral, like the movie lies about. Only Dj Yella attended Eazy's funeral, none of the others, something the movie ignores.   22. Eazy had seven children with six different women, nothing mentioned about that in the movie.  23. D.O.C came up with the name Def Row, but Dre changed it to Death Row and used that name.   24. The group had no agreed to not perform Fuck The police at first, but they got mad at the promoter because of some arguments about the money they'd get and performed it anyway. This ain't in the movie.   25. We didn't see how every N.W.A member helped Eazy with his album 'Eazy-Duz-It' and how Eazy didn't want to pay them for their help for  his album, but only for N.W.A album. Basically Eazy was selfish, along with Cube and Dre. Dre didn't pay D.O.C for his work on The Chronic. Cube felt like he was better, because e wrote half a N.W.A album, forgetting Mc Ren's part about writing.   26. Eazy owned the company, he got 25%, Heller got 20% as a manager, and that leaves  80% split five ways, Jerry didn't do nothing wrong, and if he did, you better tell me how, or the movie fails to depict him right. Jerry was portrayed wrong.   27. Eazy E came up to Jerry Heller first, the scene where Heller walks up to Eazy is not true at all.   28. Their album 'Efil4Zaggin was not mentioned or showcased in the  movie, and it was the album with more variety, controversy and misogyny than any other N.W.A album. It should have been in the movie!",195,72,mov1987,OrlLcb7zYmw,-0.004224731559290386,2016-01-03 02:51:09,False,False

Sweat flies as the testicular rhythm is heard in the next room by Dr. Dre, drooling and staring at a pair of rickety headphones like a Down Syndrome patient, eventually rocking to the nutsack BEATS cranking louder through the wall. Back in the original room, we see Eazy-E erupt into Ice Cube's asshole balls-deep and bareback, collapsing over Cube in a crack-fueled vomit spasm. With a string of bloody snot danging from his monstrously flaring nostrils and a musical twinkle in his eye, Eazy lovingly grunts into Cube's ear: ""AIDS."" Meantime -- DJ Yella and MC Ren, the size of ants, masturbate in the corner. SUPERIMPOSE: ""STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON"" The movie begins!! Credits roll as the five NWA members run through a field of cotton, naked and being chased by five giant sperm cells using their own tails as bullwhips. The sky scrolls images of racial injustice - mostly Vanilla Ice's face - until the five reach the parking lot of a McDonald's, where they are arrested. While in prison, the five notice Chuck E Cheese locked up across the corridor. After admitting that he fist-fucked a baby nun, the five refuse to talk to the rat, who proceeds to call them ""niggas with attitude."" An inspirational score rises as an epiphany rings true on all the five's faces ... except for Ice Cube, who commences to explode Eazy-E's AIDS semen out of his sphincter.",1,1,Hellzyead,OrlLcb7zYmw,0.11462418300653594,2016-03-16 19:23:29,False,False
