(Don't get me wrong they're great actors but from the trailer looks very chick flick-ish) I hope they're not too focused on making the audience laugh, just focused on making everything funny from the con to all the criminals and their interactions, the style of the movie then the actual sophistication of the con and all the con men or people's stories and personalities and how they can clash. I hope I'm wrong and this movie is actually serious and yeah some giggles along the way too like the George Clooney  Ocean 11 series. I just hope they don't make it into a chick flick, cause chick flicks are always SO predictable even the gags or jokes they make in situations.

Now, if you were to take this same cast, and put these women into a movie that isn't a ""Progressive Remodel"" of a perfectly good franchise, that could be quite the film, if it's done properly! Maybe, I don't know, a generic fantasy setting! Or, (and I can't believe I'm suggesting this for how overplayed the ideal has been since GG), a group of women who get into an online game (maybe an mmo?) together! There is NO need any of this Social Justice shit to have to be strung out and portrayed EVERYWHERE it can get light!

It sucks that every time shit like this happens people think it‚Äôs to push an agenda.  The only reason that they‚Äôre gender swapping this is for change. It‚Äôs trendy. The same thing is happening with race. A lot of characters have been race swapped as well. When the original movie came out it was probably a time when men were more in control. Hollywood is running out of ideas and I why would they make a sequel to this movie with the same gender? It‚Äôd be boring and almost the same.   I do believe that gender swapping and race swapping original characters and movies is wrong but, people‚Äôs arguments are just plain stupid and they‚Äôre hating on a movie that they haven‚Äôt even seen.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love all of these women, I think they‚Äôre all amazing, and I honestly love the idea of an all-female heist movie - my only gripe with this movie is that they didn‚Äôt change the plot. Why does it have to be a remake? Why can‚Äôt it be part of the Ocean‚Äôs series but have an original plot? I‚Äôm sure when this movie comes out, the acting will be great, the camerawork will be great, the set will be great, but the plot will be the downfall of this movie, because it has been done before. I swear if they‚Äôd just changed the plot I would be so excited for this but I know this won‚Äôt be too enjoyable because I‚Äôve basically already seen a pretty awesome rendition of the same story. This is the reason why there is always backlash when it‚Äôs an all-female remake, not because sexism, because the original movie is so great to begin with it doesn‚Äôt need a remake.

2018-05-01T01:52:06,"I have absolutely no problem with films that have strong female leads, in fact some of my favourite films have female as the main protagonist eg La Femme Nikita, The Fifth Element, Underworld, Alien etc.  However when you target films that already have a huge fan base and start pushing an agenda (like have an all female cast for no reason) then you have to expect a backlash.   In this progressive era if you dare to make a film that stars ONLY white men, then you are asking for trouble.  This is the blatant double standard, on the one hand an all female cast is seen as empowering for women (cough bullshit cough)and on the other, having a cast of only white men would probably be considered promoting white supremacy and somehow encouraging hatred and violence against women.  I am not kidding, as you can always rely of sjw dipshits and feminists to do all sorts of mental gymnastics to arrive at ridiculous conclusions.  If the goal is equal representation, then the obvious questions that one might ask is; Why do we need equal representation? Where do we draw the line?  For example, I could say that there are not enough Peter Dinklages in the film industry.  So lets starting promoting equal representation for little people.  Lets target films that had an impact on film history like Blade Runner, The Terminator, Alien, Total Recall and Back to the Future etc.  Then lets remake those films where the leads roles are all replaced with little people.  What about sick/ disabled people.  Lets find any film that stars healthy actors and replace them all with actors that are blind, deaf, who have Asperger's, or who is Autistic, who are missing limbs etc.  What about old people?  Lets target a film (like American Pie) that stars young actors and replace them with geriatrics.

That's it. You all made it about feminism and gender and male vs female, not the movie trailer.   Anyone assuming the film was made for some sort of agenda past just milking the Ocean's series, or who is hating on it purely because there are a lot of women starring in it, needs to re-examine themselves because y'all have some sexism that's deep rooted. If the first and only thing you noticed about the trailer was that there are primarily women and you have a problem with that then maybe the problem isn't the movie.   I've never been into the Ocean's movies and I agree, it'd be cooler to see something original. But if they MUST make more of them, it's nice to see they're at least switching up who they're casting for the lead roles. It could be good, it could be bad. But some of y'all are judging it super harshly just based off the trailer and purely because there are a lot of women in it. Some of you judging are probably some of the same people who get angry when ""liberal snowflakes"" talk about how they don't like how so many movies have all male leads.

I came up with a better Ocean's film idea and it took less than 5 minutes.  Years after the adventures of the heist team everyone is living well. One day Danny Ocean is murdered and Tess and Danny's son and daughter are kidnapped. The kidnappers happen to be old business associates Danny had and through flashbacks we see why Danny was murdered.  The kidnappers are demanding a large amount of gold and other extremely hard to obtain assets they have been wanting. The problem is the items the kidnappers want are constantly being moved and the time window to obtain all the items is limited. Tess has only 48 hours to complete the tasks in order to save her son and daughter.  Tess realizes she must reassemble the team along with some new members.  The heist team will consist of both women and men. The heist team will travel the world where they will face some of the most challenging tasks they have ever faced. In the film a touching tribute is made to Frank Catton who was portrayed by Bernie Mac.  Through the film we learn more about Danny Ocean and his relationship with Tess. In the film Tess discovers that Danny has left a message that explains who the kidnappers are and that they never keep their word. The heist team will have to find a way to keep Tess's children alive by stealing the necessary items, and the heist team must steal the children from the kidnappers too. The film leaves the possibility of a new trilogy open filled with new exciting characters.",1,0,David Smith,n5LoVcVsiSQ,0.16225441225441226,2018-05-17 22:18:28,True,True

Sandra Bullock and Cate Blanchett have been using a new skin beauty treatment in which the cells derived from a circumcised newborn baby boy's penis foreskin is cloned and then used on their faces for skin enhancement. Sandra Bullock and Cate Blanchett joke about their beauty treatment by referring to it as a ""penis facial"". This is appalling and these women are disgusting privileged psychopaths! Any circumcision is genital mutilation! Of course society decries female circumcision, but no one cares when male baby boy's are subjected to the mental and physical pain caused by circumcision.  Male circumcision can also cause many problems when the circumcised boys grow older. Stop supporting these Hollywood films and the people involved in making these films. Actors and actresses are just overpaid glorified thespians that we do not need in our lives. Hollywood is home of the pedophiles, rapists, and promiscuous psychopaths.

2018-06-04T23:02:26,"So this is my personal opinion but why such the hate? I understand the context where the orginal Ocean's 8 was orginally a predominant male cast geared specifcally to male audiences and is held as a nolsagic memory for many. But what I am reading thus far is that the hate directed at this reboot is the anger of the gender reversal and how is supposedly is not empowering and ""piggybanks"" on male success. Which, in theory, I do agree as in film - and especially in Hollywood - we need more female centered orginal plots that tell its own story with its own complexities. And although I would be the first to say that Hollywood is exceptional at snubbing female - especially women of color - characters needed development and instead reduces them to token prizes or eye candy directed specifcally for male eyes, I personally do see this as development. I have so far read the problem that is constantly being addressed - about the apperently uneeded women reboot - the context of the said problem is often ignored. No offense to the men that were saying that this isn't  empowering - which to extent you are right, and I am sure Hollywood is not going to give these women the justice they truly deserve - but throughout film industry, the only roles that women were allowed were an object or were ignored if they were within screenplay/editing. And in a movie world where media is such an influential tool - more in modern times than ever - it is even all that more important to see yourself in a hero or main character that looks like you; regardless who you are. And so, if you are a cis, white, heterosexual male - you will typically see a hero/villain/character who looks like you on screen, an aspect that has been true since the start of the film's origins within a segregated society. Sure now, we have gotten a bit better. But obviously it is still not enough. Look at the comments below, with - typically - men saying ""[Women] have ruined The Last Jedi"" and ""Marvel is safe for now"" all refering to the supposed negative connotations that come with increase involvement of women in francshise that were orginally geared towards men in an obviously unfair and sexist bias. All in all, though I do wish for more original female centered narratives that do not rely on popular franchises, I do believe, however, that this is nonetheless progress as it broadens the roles that women were comfined to. And besides, Hollywood has been doing so many reboots of franchises - good and bad - in a large variety of genres that do have mostly male casts, and this has not yet convinced many that men should not be involved in reboots. So why then does the game change when there is a reboot with a mostly female cast in worlds where it would not be implausable for there to be an all women team? Sure this reboot may be bad, but why should that indicate a supposed pattern that an all female cast reboots will always be bad? And so as a woman that always had to sit through interesting storylines, complex world, with virtually no women or women that were only used as a glorfoed sex doll who's emotional complexity is near to nothing, I can say that this is a nice change of pace is progress no matter how much I may like it. For once fellas, you may see the roles reversed and see that women getting a foot doesnt knock a foot off your mile. This concludes my opinion and I am open to any discussion but only in a civil manner. Thank you.",0,0,Alyssa Ramirez,n5LoVcVsiSQ,0.09964788732394364,2018-06-04 23:02:26,False,True

Sarah Connor and Ellen Ripley were well written characters made specifically for women. Trying to force women into roles originally written for men isn't interesting and it's also pathetic. Masculine women are not attractive and making lazy films like Ocean's 8 is an insult to women. Warner Bros. try making an original film made for women instead using women to promote feminism and lesbianism! At least Sucker Punch was a unique female film and the ladies trained hard to portray their characters.

2018-06-15T21:17:10,"Slap yourself real hard. Are you fully awake yet? Are you hydrated with a good meal in your stomach? Let's begin. Did you know the screenwriters for Ocean's 8 named Olivia Milch and Gary Ross are both feminists? Yes, you read that right.  Gary Ross is a male feminist which is an oxymoron. Ironically feminists are morons promoting the elitist social engineering agendas. These blokes calling themselves male feminists are too stupid to realise feminism is a women's supremacy movement and hate movement created to destroy humanity. Where have we seen a film with the same elements like Ocean's 8? Ghostbusters: Answer the Call was written by Paul Feig and Katie Dippold who are both feminists. Ghostbusters: Answer the Call promoted misandry and lesbianism just like Ocean's 8. And Ocean's 8 and Ghostbusters: Answer the Call are both rehashed feminized versions of successful masculine films. Instead of doing something that actually helps women, the elitist puppets in Hollywood spend millions on useless propaganda films which have no true benefit for women. Some of the privileged celebrities promoting the hypocritical elitist MeToo propaganda spent years taking money to keep quite about repeatedly being raped which only allowed other unsuspecting women to be raped too. Try sending aid to female victims of sexual assault and abuse. Try helping all the single mums out there who are struggling to provide for their children. How about using your millions to help the women of the Middle East who still struggle to live decent lives. Where are the feminists helping to free women trapped in prostitution and the adult film industry which promotes women selling their bodies for financial gain? Oddly enough many feminists are prostitutes and adult film actresses.  All this talk about equality from feminists, yet I don't read about feminists standing against male circumcision which is male genital mutilation.  Where are the feminists standing against the biased against males in domestic violence cases and sexual assault cases? Where are the feminists standing against females who repeatedly make false sexual assault claims against males? Why aren't feminists demanding equal treatment in court for males and men who are dealing with divorce? Feminism is an social engineering tool rooted in Marxism which was designed to destabilize society. For years feminists removed femininity from females in their delusional mission to compete with men and prove that women can be men too. Feminists spent years making males weak submissive creatures who must constantly watch what they say and do in regards to females. And some women wonder why men no longer want to be married. Masculine females are not attractive to heterosexual males. Women can't be men and men can't be women. If you don't believe that I would like to see documented medical evidence where a woman produced sperm in their ovaries. Males and females can never be equal because we are not the same. There's a reason why women and men do not compete against each other in professional sports. This perpetual gender war to make everything equal is a lie which only divides humanity just like the elite planned. It's amazing people can't see the elite are trolling people with these blatant gender politics and social justice propaganda films. The true meaning and purpose of these scripted ""news"" articles and films should be as easy to spot as red spray paint on your white walls. Stop letting the elite tell you how to think, act, and live. Look at what is happening to society. Do you think it's a coincidence we have many people who now identify as LGBTQ? What happens to the global population when nuclear families, traditional relationships, and monogamy is eliminated? Ocean's 8 is a direct psychological attack by the elite on humanity which promotes misandry, lesbianism, and divisiveness.  https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/newsbeat-44479425",3,0,David Smith,n5LoVcVsiSQ,0.014485695463956338,2018-06-15 21:17:10,False,True

Ocean's 8 is a terrible film because  it's another lazy uninspired film falsely proclaiming empowerment. I have no biased against women.  I support humanity. üöª Women are amazing, and it's great to know there are still feminine women out there who don't have to prove how strong they are. A special acknowledgement to the single mums out there providing for their children. Also thank you to all the feminine supportive wives and girlfriends out there who don't keep spreadsheets on how much of the relationship is gender equal. How sad that the elite puppets of Hollywood would have people believe that Ocean's 8 is empowering women. A group of overpaid glorified thespians that live like kings for playing pretend in front of a camera isn't empowering women. Ocean's 8 is cash grab rubbish promoting misandry, lesbianism, and divisiveness just like Ghostbusters: Answer the Call. For those of you who haven't seen Incredibles 2, don't be surprised when you see the blatant feminism Disney is selling as a family film. Also beware feminist Brie Larson will portray Captain Marvel who will be the most powerful character in the MCU ever according to Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige.  Brie Larson said her Captain Marvel can move planets.  And Kevin Feige said Captain Marvel will be the new face of the MCU. Is anyone surprised after all the social justice propaganda Marvel has been putting in their comics? Also do not let your children watch  Disney's Zootopia.

The best parts in my opinion, were Cate Blanchett's ""Lou"" character and Anne Hathaway's ""Daphne Kluger"" character, who stole the show and had the most laughs. They payed homage to Ocean's 11, which I liked, but it also forced me to make comparisons between this and Ocean's 11, which made me like this less. This heist wasn't as crisp and tight as Danny's casino heist. The characters weren't as starkly outlined in this as the 11 were--and Ocean's 8 has some great characters too. They could've played that up more. They reused Yen, the acrobat, which I thought was a cop-out. They couldn't find a lady acrobat? Maybe they just wanted him to make an appearance, but to me it made the heist feel sloppier. Yen should also get a cut of the money right? Do the other Ocean's 8 members know? It was never mentioned. And then Daphne Kluger also gets a cut? Was that planned? Maybe? 6 of the 8 Ocean's crew members didn't even know about the majority of the jewels that ended up being stolen. Did Sandra Bullock just let them in on it out of good will? ""Weee! We're rich out of nowhere!"" I guess. Then at the end, Sandra Bullock gives her ""dead"" brother a toast and says ""you would've loved it."" To me this takes away from the new Ocean's crew. I don't know.

Story is just of medium quality compared to what we are used to these days. It might have been a success 10 or 15 years ago. But how do you make a better movie in a franchise? you have to maintain the idea while keeping the viewers excited with ""harder, faster, smarter"" scenes. Obviously you will fail at some point. Like Fast n Furious and Transformers did. Cars falling/flyn in the sky and 50 explosions in 3 seconds. What would that mean for Oceans? How much more complicated and sneaky can you make it before most of the viewers simply wont be able to follow anymore?  Id rather aks two questions:  1. why was it necessary to do an all female (or all men) cast? why not just mix it, what would have been the problem with that? The world is full with men AND women. 2. If you decide to make or participate in a franchise movie, why not wait for a script that actually has the potential to be better than the ones before? why do they keep coming up with movies that are clearly not gonna be successes?  I repeat: to me Oceans 8 was not a bad movie, but it clearly failed on too many levels to ever become a success.

Gary Ross also directed Ocean's 8 too. Ocean's 8 is blatant feminist propaganda masquerading as good entertainment that falsely claims it empowers women. There is nothing empowering about feminizing a masculine film franchise and then whining about the expected backlash. These gender politics films featuring rehashed feminist versions of masculine films are an insult to women.  Congrats feminists on proving your false gender equality movement is still desperate and pathetic. Blaming and shaming blokes while hijacking masculine things is the feminist strategy.  Add Ocean's to the list of masculine film franchises hijacked by feminists. The new planned Terminator films will feature a female lead that the films will revolve around.
