2015-03-28T11:44:53,"I think I have solved the QUANTUM problem, and the link to SPECTRE.  It's SMERSH.  SMERSH was the original soviet organization behind everything in majority of Fleming's novels, long before SPECTRE (which didn't come into play until the novel Thunderball).  In the bond movies, they replaced SMERSH with SPECTRE.  SMERSH is only mentioned twice, and both times it is a ruse.  I am thinking that QUANTUM has taken SMERSH's place.  However, due to the events of Casino Royale, QOS, and Skyfall, QUANTUM has fallen or has weakened.  But as we can see that when you just remove one evil, another emerges (like in the Middle-East).  SPECTRE is that new evil.  It is stronger than QUANTUM, deeper rooted, and has no allegiances to no one.  But then there's one more thing, the leader . . . Bond's adopted brother . . . BLOFELD!!!  Yes, I am calling it.  Just like 006 and 007 in Goldeneye, they grew up together.

2015-04-04T18:30:34,"'Oberhauser taught climbing and skiing in Kitzb√ºhel before World War II. He even taught James Bond during his youth while he was on term breaks while attending Fettes College. He formed a very strong paternal relationship with James, to such an extent that he later referred to him as his second father. After the annexation of Austria and outbreak of war with Great Britain he was drafted into the Gestapo, probably due to his ability to speak English.  One day, in the closing weeks of the war, a British officer arrived by jeep at Oberhauser's chalet and arrested him. He had told his weeping, protesting family that he was being taken to an interrogation camp in Munich. If the Oberhauser's record was clean he would be released within a week. If his family caused a drama it would just make things worse for Oberhauser.  The officer and Oberhauser drove off and Oberhauser was told that in exchange for assisting him climbing the Kaiser range, he would report to his commanding officer that he had been cleared at Munich. He guided the Englishman up the mountain to a hut where he was shot point blank in the back of the skull by the officer's Webley & Scott .45 pistol. His body was then pushed off the mountain onto a glacier below.  Twenty years later, Oberhauser's corpse was discovered by mountaineers and the case for his murder was re-opened. As serendipity had it, the case was noticed by James Bond, who set out to discover the one responsible for his friend's death"".

From what I‚Äôve determined from this teaser is that I think that ‚ÄúSpectre‚Äù will be the darkest outing in Daniel Craig‚Äôs reign as 007 surpassing that of Casino Royale and Skyfall respectively. Tying up all loose ends to reveal a more devastating criminal organisations as illustrated by Mr White; ‚ÄúSpectre‚Äù.  With Christoph Waltz‚Äôs alluring, soothing but at the same time sinister voice just adds to the mystery and anticipation surrounding his character and the role that he is to play. For is he the head of Spectre or merely a supporting General???  One thing¬†for certain is that Spectre will surpass Skyfall as the most successful film in the Bond franchise.

Iger,  My name is Callum Precious and I'm come from the UK but I just heard the news that Sony to retire distribution rights to the Bond films after the release of Spectre this November. I only understand that The Walt Disney Company will buy James Bond, a spy movie franchise that spanned for over 50 years. To myself that Warner Bros' distribution rights to 007 is very unlikely but it is likely that 007 franchise will go into Walt Disney Pictures; much like Marvel and Lucasfilm. The ideal of Disney's acquisition of the franchise goes into my head since 2013, and to make sure that Disney to be a #1 bidder to buy the world's most successful franchise from Sony. Meaning that Disney will reunite with MGM since 1985 because they entered a licencing contract to form a Disney World called 'Disney-MGM Studios' (now Disney's Hollywood Studios) and was officially opened on May 1st 1989. Thank you and i wilko hope that is going to happen this Christmas :-)  Your Sincerely  Callum Precious",0,0,dwho1995 Entertainment,ashLaclKCik,0.3,2015-06-06 00:21:56,True,True

2015-09-04T15:37:11,"These films have always fascinated me for one reason: the idea of there being secret organizations that not even the CIA or MI-6 know about. As an aspiring Nietzsche scholar, I have always asked myself 'where have the strong gone? where does power truly reside?' Now this may seem like an overly normative, fanboy theory, but I like to think that the strong have become so impossibly powerful that they're unrecognizable even to the most perceptive individuals. In our times, it is not the physically superior and apparently threatening that are best able to bend people to their will, but rather, the deceitful. In Plato's dialogue 'Gorgias', Socrates confronts the craft of oratory (manipulation through persuasion) and is told by its master Calicles that it is the art of getting people to do whatever you want. But what's interesting about the dialogue is that Calicles does not confront Socrates until his two students Gogias and Polous (his henchmen) have been dispensed with, instead, he waits in relative silence while assessing Socrates. As i understand it, SPECTER is responsible for training many of Bonds adversaries in Counter-intelligence, terrorism, extortion and so on. In the context of the Bond trilogy, perhaps SPECTER is our Calicles, while Quantum and Skyfall, despite there brilliance, are mere henchmen; subsidiary players. I do not doubt the plausibility of there being secret players such as these in the real world, people with anti-ethical and impersonal motives who conduct themselves ubiquitously and are the closest thing to power personified. But what's important to keep in mind though is that when power is so condensed, so concentrated, it begins to lose any and all identity...something external to all men, where even characters such as the one portrayed by Christopher Waltz, are merely its puppets.",0,0,Drew,ashLaclKCik,0.1865079365079365,2015-09-04 15:37:11,True,True

Tom Hardy would be better as the new Wolverine not bond and Hugh Jackman has said that Tom Hardy would be perfect for Wolverine. Hugh Jackman was offered the bond role once and has said he would consider it if offered again. Plus George Lazenby was Australian and he was the 2nd bond so it wouldn't be a huge deal that his not british and we know Hugh can pull of a British accent.
