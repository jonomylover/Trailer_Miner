That completely changes the whole genre of the film. And don't get me wrong, I love science fiction, I ADORE IT actually. But I am sick and tired of people equating every little thing to feminism. They had an opportunity but obviously the writers didn't want this to become a scifi movie. Which is completely ok with me. And that is because it's still interesting, I think the plot, albeit not original,is beautiful. So yes hopefully someday someone will make a bad ass, strong but weak, riveting, complex, and immortal woman that finds the cure for cancer and her team of scientists are mostly women.

She is appropriately sad and the continuing generations of the same dog thing really does deserve some recognition, like a ballpeen hammer in the phrenologist's heavy hand. Come on, like the story and the good actress couldn't carry the weight? So this putzy and ditzy character is a hundred plus and hasn't discovered much about human nature. She should be in an isolated valley running human hunting trips. I can't think of a man or woman that wouldn't be that way after a century. After a whole century she's still such a victim! That steams me and now I wanna shit on someone's car and eat their rose bushes. Can you believe that harrison actually thought he could act? Thankfully I can't get my hoof down my throat or I'd be yakking up my third stomach. Adaline and her daughter do MAKE the movie. The throwaway other characters are worthless and pointless and a waste of time. The story could have been a revelation instead of a maudlin retelling of the american victimization story. Because if a rich white woman can still hit the high hard one after a century, she sure as hell wouldn't be playing the perennial victim.
