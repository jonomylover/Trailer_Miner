Having to be the best and create dishes that are perfect would make anyone crazy. Which Bradley captures as a man seeking redemption yet at the same time he wants the prestige.He does it the only way he knows through manipulation and his own desire which in fact was what ended his success. The relationship between Reece and Adam truly captures the respect they have for their craft which involves jealousy, competitiveness for each other but there is an unspoken respect and understanding which ultimately allow us to relate to Adam. It is at the end when Adam is having a melt down he chooses an adversary rather then a friend to see him at his weakness who understand . Love this movie and I thought I would not.
