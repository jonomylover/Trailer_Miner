So i'm a big military history guy and i've been with my family to alot of veterans associations and parades, etc. (before a dumbass makes a racist comment about blacks despite them fighting for the country kicking ass in many wars up through today)  Now. With that said: *WHY IS THIS AN INTEGRATED UNIT IN WORLD WAR II?!?!?* LOL. This isn't debateable, there's no other 'opinions'. ""It's 100% flat historical fact that the military was de facto segregated*. Hollywood isn't dumb enough not to know this as they've made dozens of World War II movies for decades including those that ACKNOWLEDGE THIS LOL. I just don't get why the hell they couldn't even bother with this fact just out of desperation to have a 'black protagonist'. They could've easily done this and had two units stranded in one location, one black one white--which would've made a good paranoia scenario once you throw zombies in the mix--thus gotten what you wnated, had a black soldier character shooting guns, explosions, CGI, FX, gore, etc lol everything that they had in this trailer. Don't get me wrong, despite that this is obviously a rip off of Frankenstein's Monsters, Wolfenstein and Call of Duty: Zombies DLC I still love to be entertained by this movie. The concept is fun and looks badass. I just hate how they totally fucked up with THAT historical accuracy which was so in your face and OBVIOUS during the 40's!  I mean is there an explanation for why the guy is even flying in with other soldiers? It's not even acknowledged ore explained lol. It's just ""oh hey....time to go on a special mission"". I'm of the school where I hate hyper-PC crap, I feel having a genuinely written story and role for minority characters is better than ignoring history just to shoe-horn someone in to be a Token.

2018-07-20T19:09:21,All this hype over this movie came because of cloverfield. Someone wanted us to believe that it was going to be apart of it. It can still be a blood relative just like 10 cloverfield lane. Idk why thats so hard for people to to understand. JJ DID come out and say it's not related but so did the director for 10 cloverfield lane. Im not saying 100% but it's still a possibility. True fans know how jj Abrams is he is very sneaky and does his work very differently from most producers!! Dont forget that! He doesn't need to be like everyone else and make sequel that connect 100% he does his work differently and since paradox has came out netflix is releasing more movie trailers now I'm noticing. Great trailer for a movie called how it ends and extinction. Netflix trailers weren't really in my you tune trending like it is now so. Paradox was definitely a surprise and started alot. It could be a small Easter egg or literally anything I'd like to see some slusho or tagruarto related in this movie but if not it's okay. All I'm saying is that someone started the rumor that this was a cloverfield movie and we believed it for awhile until jj came out and said what he had to say. Why did someone want us to believe it was related? That's all I'm saying. It's still possible. It can still be a blood relative but we will see.

They just stuck a black guy in that role cause muh diversity....  Why not stick a few black guys on the German side too. And while your at it throw in a few female front line combat troops because wahman power.  Imagine for one second the outrage that would happen if they made a movie based in Africa like (Zulu, Shaka Zulu or Black Panther, etc), but the lead character(and only a few others) was white... in Africa... killing black people... and all the bad guys are black...  For fucks sake at least structure the plot where it makes sense. Have him be a Tuskegee Airman that gets shot down or SOMETHING. Although they didn't participate in Operation overlord.  Hollywood loves remakes. Let's remake Tuskegee Airman with the lead character being a white guy(the only one in the whole squadron) that gets all the kills and girls... because diversity is our strength. Even better let's make him a Latino trans man cause yeah gender isn't a thing anymore so why would it be back in the 1940's either.  No, you lunatics just don't care. You want everyone to know him being black is special just because what? Black people are better than white people? Diversity is our strength? You're the worst sort of racist. Because you think your racism is a good thing.  You know what I hate most... You cramming diversity down my throat over and over and over and OVER again makes me notice it and brings out the worst side in me. I shouldn't even notice it. I certainly  shouldn't have to defend my race... because you shouldn't be attacking it.  Don't get me wrong. I respect the black soldiers and airman that did serve in WWII a lot. 700 of them died. I don't have a problem with black lead actors either. I just watch Equalizer 2. Great movie. I'm just sick and tired of Hollywood rewriting history(or worse re-writing established sci-fi or comic book plots/characters) purely for the sake of shoving down everyone's throat that they are a bunch of SJW, virtue signaling, racist, fuck-tards.

So ANY depiction of black paratroopers of infantry assaulting the beaches at Normandy is just ""feelz gud"" PC nonsense. Eventually in late 44 there were all black TD (Tank Destroyer) battalions and I think a couple of artillery battalions and maybe (?) a combat engineer regiment, ALL black EXCEPT the officers who were white. That's it for combat arms on the ground. The Army wasn't integrated until AFTER the Korean War, in the mid-late fifties. During the Korean War there were black infantry units. They were officered by whites and were poorly led and equipped. This led to disastrous consequences in battle. The units had very poor morale as they were horribly treated. The result were several instances where the units disentigrated when attacked and they were routed. A board of inquiry exonerated the troops and several white officers were cashiered from service.

2018-11-07T13:01:59,"Marilor Bastille Marilor Bastille 3 minutes ago Everyday I find new reason to work this Masterful Arrangement into my song lists. When I discovered the English translation of the Palace shortly to go into space, just had made hearing this at the same time, well folks, it always make me Smile. Odd I had been listening to it when a same and strangely familiar type story broke recently from the ISS. As the Space Babe (That's Doctor Space Babe to all you misogynistic types)  spoke of oft broken items, DNA, and Plants... Is it Weird A Billionaire From a Manor as Stately as Bruce Wayne's had gone to give an address carrying a simple jar of message? Nope.  As Paul Harvey might have said had this been the end of a VERY LONG running story indeed, 'Good Day'. Would love too, save That Reel to Real topic still in play. Rampage had just been One of those at the same time in first run items listing as the above had occurred.   Good Governance of and Worthy Peoples to such lofty heights as ALL  Mankind strives towards in such endeavors, are rare. The Russians, and all the rest of us whom made it into space? Well, long traditions of how to achieve such lofty goals has been addressed LONG before any of these every left the inception stage of the planning tables.  Hiram Abiff (Protector of High Offices) an the architect, heard of these Goals Mankind has begun to achieve and proudly took that place... in the words of Tom Wilson, to point that message out to you one and all as the Worlds Governments came under attack.  Good thing the story of that Biff is the same one which Hiram Abiff's life story had been Stolen from, as Zero Point in the here and now.  An earnest prayer later an Archangel appeared, as oom mau mau had been observed at the Pan Star Looker, and went shooting by our tiny planet. Yes the same Pan where a Man with roots in Kenya and former High Office Holder is from.  That same Kenya where a  POW's had learned of Her Fathers passing and been Proclaimed Queen, second of her name as Line. That same Kenya Where a young couple had been Married after sharing true loves first kiss in Japan at the end of WWII, had then moved into a dwelling on Lunatic Lane. That said same couples line sent with an EPIC KIC', proof that The High Offices of the World will never be made to stand alone ever again. Yet that alone would not convince some. So other signs had been sent of Heaven for the here and now. What signs you may rightly ask? The Stars themselves just as the mythical Dave Bowman had said. With all manor of ways to discern them, and why. Another former High Office Holder had addressed this very topic one day to a U N General Assembly. That same one whom would utter that same phrase from an aforementioned flick. Yes that same flick which would allow for the I.D.ing of That same High Office Holder there today... so do keep firmly in mind, words as well as acronyms with two meanings won't you please? As you ask yourselves twin questions: What makes a Red Man red, and What's a Motto? For that day when They ask Us, How? For now, simply state: What's A Motto? This Latan Phrase:  Primus Aut Nullus. PAN for short. THAT same PAN also known sometimes as an Observatory, or Hiram Abiff. You see, It's in how you look at those words, HI  RAM A BIFF which are the key to understanding them. As THIS  MARVELOUS Song is place on That Play List today. And although THIS is not the rest of that story, Good Day for now, and may your Fears be laid to rest on some of these issues for the here and now today.

Not many people can pull that kind of thing off.    In my complete, unbiased opinion, Overlord does an exceptional job at putting together supernatural elements in the historical setting. It's strange to think about it. You know this isn't non-fictional, and you know it couldn't have happened, yet it feels so much like a classic WW2 movie..   There is a nice balance between the main characters coming into conflict with both the infected zombies and human German soldiers, which adds for a very nice mixture. Like rum and coke :)   If you're looking for the more charming aspect of WW2, then you won't be disappointed. The film fits the setting very well. For example, there is one scene where an Allied soldier is using an MG-42, and his friend next to him tells him to hurry up when he reloads. The soldier using the machine gun then responds unpleasantly, ""It's a two person gun you idiot!"" I know it isn't a huge example, but the fact of the matter still stands. There is accurate usage of weaponry for the most part with excellent sound design.     I would give it a solid 8/10 which is surprising for a movie that is literally nicknamed ""Nazi Zombies""",0,0,Smittywerbenjaegermanjensen d,USPd0vX2sdc,0.19333333333333333,2018-11-12 09:35:29,False,True

It does not look like a cheaply made film and the special effects are done well but at certain points you have to suspend your disbelief, and that doesn‚Äôt even involve the Nazi super serum.   For example there is a part in the movie where they are hiding in a house and they have to keep quiet because the Germans are patrolling the town. They capture one of the officers but they don‚Äôt ever gag him and you have to believe this soldier would not scream for help. And yes he could just be trying to stay alive because the Americans would kill him if he screamed but this is a member of the Waffen SS, they‚Äôre the elite of the German Army.  Another comes when they get to torturing this officer for information, the dude still doesn‚Äôt scream for help but in the process of torturing him they appear to make a lot of noise. Now I don‚Äôt know how old French houses are built, maybe they are soundproof with no door closing off the place they are torturing the officer at from the rest of the house but it begins to kill the idea if they have to be quiet.  It is a beautiful film to look at with some okay actors and and meh plot.

Complaining about how a black soldier with a white squadron is ""sickeningly inaccurate"" in your Nazi zombie WW2 horror movie... Like who cares? Jovan Adepo really brought something with his role and if you ever watched the movie instead of just the trailer like it seems 90% of y'all did, you would find that the movie remains entirely apolitical and there are no ""agendas"" that are being pushed. Not even subtly.  If your reaction to seeing a black man and a woman in a WW2 movie is to recoil in hatred and disgust at the ""inaccuracy"" you might just be a racist and a misogynist. FYI: the woman in the movie isn't a soldier. She's not even a civilian resistance fighter. She's just a regular French chick who just so happens to get roped in with the main crew on their quest to kick Nazi-zombie ass.

2019-03-06T13:55:51,"Think this is a good movie (good plot, acting, and general production) but feel its also unnecessarily ruined by being too blatantly PC. Its not a train-smash but I think its sad that the such a well made movie is ""diminished"" for such a reason. I've resigned myself to expect a bit of PC in every movie (and series) that comes out these days, though it would be nice if they could be a bit more subtle (and realistic) about it.    The argument that ""its just a zombie/fantasy movie, so who cares?"" is really not good enough here. The basic purpose of any fantasy movie is to ""immerse"" the audience in the fantasy world and make it ""believable"" up to point where you don't really notice the ""fantasy/falsehood"", ie. you're ""sucked in"". So, obviously zombies are fantasy creatures but ""unrealistic zombies"" are also immersion-breaking. In this case, the zombies were done well, however, making movies (or series, or anything) based in historical times (whether it includes a fantasy element of zombies, robot dinosaurs, or rainbow unicorns, etc), where a general standard of realism is upheld EXCEPT when it comes to racism and racial segregation, which, for some weird unexplained reason, doesn't exist, or is ignored, or altered into contrived unrealistic scenarios, is also just really strange and immersion-breaking.   Because its ""noticeable"" (and in my opinion ""suspicious""), and it instantly pops the spell-binding bubble of fantasy that movie had been weaving up till then. In this movie its right from he beginning. Its not that I didn't like Adepo's (and Woodbine's) performances. I thought they were great. Within the story I just thought their positions and relationships with the other soldiers ""within the context of the era in which it was set"" was noticeably contrived, and it set an unnecessary ""unrealistic tone"" to the movie right from the start.

Feeling thirsty while you‚Äôre out? Just head to a nearby shop and buy some bottled water. In addition to being an easily accessible form of hydration, it‚Äôs also believed that bottled water is safer and healthier to drink compared to tap water. However, a recent study says otherwise.     USA TODAY Money ‚úî @USATODAYmoney  A test conducted by an Oakland nonprofit finds Pe√±afiel and Starkey bottled water contain levels of arsenic that violate state guidelines. http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/603323836/0/usatodaycommoney-topstories~High-levels-of-arsenic-in-bottled-water-sold-at-Whole-Foods-Target-Walmart-study-says/ ‚Ä¶   7 4:37 PM - Jun 20, 2019 Twitter Ads info and privacy   High levels of arsenic in bottled water sold at Whole Foods, Target, Walmart, study says A test conducted by an Oakland nonprofit finds Pe√±afiel and Starkey bottled water contain levels of arsenic that violate state guidelines.   usatoday.com See USA TODAY Money's other Tweets Bottled water is purchased at extremely high rates, especially in places like Flint, Michigan where there is currently a water crisis and people have no choice but to turn to bottled water for clean water. However, bottled water may not be as safe as you think. A test conducted by the California nonprofit Center for Environmental Health found that two bottled water brands‚ÄîStarkey, owned by Whole Foods and Pe√±afiel, owned by Keurig Dr. Pepper‚Äîcontained levels of arsenic higher than tap water. The level of arsenic is so high that this violates state guidelines.       California law states that high levels of arsenic can cause cancer and reproductive harm. Therefore, products that violate the recommended state levels of arsenic need to be labeled with a warning.   ‚ÄúCustomers typically purchase bottled water at exorbitantly high costs with the assumption that it is safer and healthier to drink than tap water, unaware that they are ingesting an extremely toxic metal linked to birth defects and cancer,‚Äù Michael Green, the organization‚Äôs CEO, said in a statement.   Studies also show that high levels of arsenic can cause organ damage and hormone disruption, especially in children as their bodies are still developing.   According to the study: ‚ÄúDirect exposure can affect mental and physical development [‚Ä¶] Arsenic can even harm an unborn child as a result of exposure to pregnant women or women likely to become pregnant. Arsenic in drinking water can cause an increased risk of heart disease, including high blood pressure and diabetes. The metal is also what is known as an ‚Äòendocrine disrupting chemical,‚Äô which means even small doses can wreak havoc on a human‚Äôs hormone system.‚Äù   This study corroborates independent findings released earlier this year by Consumer Reports. The findings stated that the same brands of bottled water had nearly double the federal limit of arsenic levels in their water.",0,0,Marilor Bastille,USPd0vX2sdc,0.06304166666666668,2019-06-22 01:37:19,False,False

2019-09-27T16:43:11,"Just a quick critical review and i know im late to review it. Before i watched this movie at a discount theatre i have not heard of this movie. I didnt watch any trailers prior to seeing it but judging by the title i assumed it was about ww2. When the movie started it was a full on ww2 experience. The planes, flack, the static line jump, and the normandy landing was grade A ww2 filmmaking. And i didnt discover the twist from ww2 to fiction until the ""van helsing village scene."" I think we all secretly wanted a nazi zombies movie and i wasnt dissapointed. Overall a 9/10 movie. Now the only thing (i know people have said it dosent matter) was the black soldier. I 100% agree, It really dosent matter since it is fiction. However, my initial reaction to the ww2 setting in the beginning was outstanding and when the camera showed a black dude in a stick of all white dudes my reaction was like more than confused and i think this is because i was expecting an immersive ww2 film judging from the first opening scene, but the main issue is that i also  thought this film was going to break that trend in todays media on forced diversity since it was going to be about ww2. Obviously i knew right away it was fiction after the opening scene so i didnt care if the dude was black. Diversity is good and should be an important part in any movie but you can tell that if they didnt include at least one diverse character then it would be considered ""racist."" I loved the movie but, feel free to disagree with me, i believe that forced diversity, political agendas, or political stances needs to be removed or banned from all entertainment. There are many examples of forced diversity in a lot of movies and video games and this needs to stop.",0,0,Adrian Medina,USPd0vX2sdc,0.09047619047619047,2019-09-27 16:43:11,False,False
