2018-03-15T05:12:43,I am currently in my last three months of eighth grade and I can definitely say that it's been quiet the interesting year. back in November I found out that many of my friends were suffering from substance abuse of many kinds and they all got expelled from the school. Then I found out that one of my closest friends had been sexually assaulted in the fifth grade by another one of my friends and that she had been cutting herself in the bathroom between classes and that the school was doing nothing to help her or to punish her assaulter. This was the year that I realized that many of the people that i've been friends are really horrible people and now I only like to hang out with one of my closest friends.

A pretentious, pandering film that tween and teenage girls will enjoy the most, in addition to those who believe that Burnham can do no wrong.

2018-03-15T15:25:46,"I‚Äôm in 8th grade right now, dunno why everybody is saying how bad 8th grade is/was. I guess the reason why is the fact that I never got into the social media side of being at my age (14). I do think me not going into the social media circle has befitted me greatly so I haven‚Äôt had to constantly think that I have to be better looking etc. I‚Äôm not the ‚Äòpopular‚Äô one at school but I don‚Äôt care, I care about being happy for who I am instead of having people to tell me how cool I am constantly. To recap: social media is just plain not good for people at my age because of what it does to everyday people and gives us false expectations of what we should be.  Edit:  To clarify: I didn‚Äôt mean my comment to get this much attention, it was just my two cents. What I meant by ‚Äòunrealistic expectations‚Äô is that on social media almost everybody is trying to show off the best of themselves and showing their best photos of them. This leads to people who feel like they ‚Äòhave to have this‚Äô or ‚Äòhave to do that‚Äô to just fit in with the crowd.

2018-03-15T17:40:31,"In the late 60's LB Johnson was upset because pastors in Churches had mentioned that he took the money out of the social security trust fund. Johnson was also upset that churches didn't embrace his great society program. So Johnson attacked the churches. Preachers free speech was stopped through the IRS. He said you can speak all you want,but you will pay taxes on your offerings and buildings. At that same time Johnson was not worried about teachers,and teachers unions speaking for government plans and against churches. Schools and teachers are paid by the public,so they are even more entrenched than preachers.We had teachers,in tax payer funded buildings,preaching to a captive audience,that was underage and vulnerable to their message. The teacher pays taxes on income,but so does the preacher. As a result we have had 50 years of brain washing forced on students and paid for by tax payers. During Obama's first run,teachers were wearing Obama shirts,preaching Obama,singing hymns of praise to Obama,and they did the same for Clinton. I'm sure in the upcoming elections teachers will become preachers for the leftist dogma and churches will remain tax free and silent.",0,0,Dave Ryan,y8lFgF_IjPw,0.12888888888888891,2018-03-15 17:40:31,True,True

2018-03-15T22:22:12,"""Being yourself"" and ""real you"" is code word for people to be a completely narcissist and self worshipping, driven by purely emotional feelings empty soul. That's the last thing you want to be is yourself.  What if you are selfish, egotistical, shallow, cruel, never caring about others, only about yourself, always hurting others but 'you're happy so who cares' loser ? Do you want to be that? Its a stupid saying that millenials say because they don't want to face and look in the mirror of who they really are and change. It is nothing statement. It leads to nothing. No growth ever comes from 'being yourself'. Growth comes from listening to others, respecting others, and able to have your preconceived ideas of the world challenged and changed. It requires thought and actual desire for the Truth.

That‚Äôs my eight grade experience. 9th grade I would go into the bathroom during lunch and look up at the ceiling and scream as loud as I could to express me solitude for my body full of zits. I would then eat my lunch using the toilet seat as a table and made sure to lick off the side of the toilet to get all the pee I could manage to get. And then I rubbed my dick on all the door knobs and handles. I did this in the girls room and only got caught a couple times. But it makes me sexually active to watch another person stare at me while I express my bodily motion in a fashion they have yet to understand. Only to get on the bus and stare at this middle school boy where they shared the bus with us because our school was poor. When I finally got home I laid on the floor and put my finger in my butt and just laid there for hours on end until I felt it was necessary to put my finger in my mouth.,1,3,Lil Schleep,y8lFgF_IjPw,0.08111111111111109,2018-03-16 16:56:59,True,True

You perfectly captured the struggle of not just a 13-year-old girl, but of a human being. This is an accurate portrayal of life's struggles and the emotions that everyone deals with at some point in his or her life. Most importantly you showed the possibility of getting through the tough times and accepting ourselves for the weird, quirky individuals we are. I can tell the genuine feelings that you poured into this movie, and for that I say thank you!

It was a nightmare and I hated it so much. I was so happy when I graduated, even though a good chunk of the kids would be moving on to the same high school. HS was still easier for me, at least in terms of bullying. People were still assholes and a number of them hated me for no reason, but HS brought me my very first legitimate group of real friends. Yes, I had a couple of friends growing up, but I was always the very shy, awkward one that liked to be invisible more than seen. Obviously, I was prime bully fodder.   Watching this movie will probably be very relatable to me on some aspects, but, as a child who grew up in the 80s and 90s, who was bullied by her peers and mother, I doubt it could capture the experiences that led to my PTSD later in life. Her father, especially, looks very supportive and loving, which I guess I can relate to, as my father was a very loving man.

What made it even ‚Äúworse‚Äù is my dad was an 8th grade teacher at the same school I went to while I was in 8th grade. My dad was embarrassing and awkward, ‚Äúcool‚Äù teacher (still is tbh haha! But it‚Äôs fun now), everyone in the school knew who he was, and therefore everyone knew who I was. So I ALWAYS stood out, even if I didn‚Äôt want to.  I can‚Äôt sit through this movie without getting up and walking out of the room, because it brings back so many memories and makes me cringe. But that just shows it‚Äôs effectiveness! This movie is amazing and probably one of the only movies that accurately portrays what it‚Äôs like to be in middle school. Trying to impress the popular crowd, talking to boys, dealing with parents, and just all the other awkward moments that come with becoming a teenager; I remember going through every single moment of it all. It makes me laugh, cringe, breaks my heart, and just brings back a lot of embarrassing moments from that time of my life that, even looking back on them now, I still wouldn‚Äôt change today. Going through what you go through as a teenager shapes you into who you‚Äôre going to become in the future, whether you believe that or not.  I used to say that I would ‚Äúslap my younger self‚Äù, but now I think if I could go back in time, I would give her/myself a hug and tell her that ‚ÄúDad is right, just like he always is. Everything is going to turn out okay. You‚Äôll find your best friends for life, fall in love a few times, meet the love of your life, finally start to believe and have confidence in yourself, discover your passions, and realize everything really is going to be all right.‚Äù  So thank you, Bo.
