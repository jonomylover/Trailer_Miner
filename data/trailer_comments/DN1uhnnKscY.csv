There's been so many book adaptions out recently and I'd hate to see another good book series go to waste (ex: the Percy Jackson series and The Mortal Instruments series are great teen fantasy novels with a large following that should have been successful, but their films didn't hold up well).  I had heard of this book and had seen it around, it was until I saw the first trailer that I got intrigued enough to go out and read it. Seeing this second trailer now having officially finished the book, I'm honestly very excited! Although I'm a little concerned with this new version of Emma (she doesn't seem very similar to her book character, especially with the whole change in powers) I'm sure there's a reason for the change.

2016-06-22T14:14:15,I think what I hate most about this trailer and everyone who's commenting discount or mix of two preexisting things is that you only get a little glimpse as to what the book is actually about. There's no real mention of Jacob's grandfather and how it takes place during world war 2 and now most of these kids are refugees from the war. It's literally staring you right in the face in the book. It gives it a deep meaning. But here I feel like that just wanted to show off how good the CGI was. Also bring back Emma she was perfect and great and it was cute because her and Jacob where opposites who fall in love. I hope this movie tanks honestly,0,0,fightmefairy,DN1uhnnKscY,0.26863839285714286,2016-06-22 14:14:15,True,True

Like people are making X-men jokes, but the fact is they have a point, because here the peculiarities are being played as superpowers in a lot of ways; but in most cases in the books their abilities are just... there. Olive is lighter than air, but that's all she can do - she can't manipulate air or weaponise it. She just floats. Hugh just happens to have a swarm of bees living inside him, Milton (?) is perpetually invisible. But their peculiarities are limited, and are just that: peculiarities. Not superpowers that make them 'superhuman', which is the tone I get from the trailers. They're just kids, who can each do one quite limited strange thing.

I mean the last ten minutes is practically unrecognisable, and all the changes has led to a few minor plot holes. Also, why can't Dr Golan see the hollows in the movie?

The entire plot felt like it was written by a high schooler's idea of ""deep and profound,"" it's far too stupid to be worthwhile to adults and too creepy to be appropriate for kids. When I first saw the preview I could guess more or less at the gist of the plot,and ofc it turned out more or less like what I suspected-- because it's just so chock full of cliche after cliche. The only worthwhile thing about it is the creativity in the 'weird' factor, but other than that it's like every character in this story acts like a melodramatic teenager's juvenile perception of what those people must be like-- as opposed to a mildly credible depiction.   (For example, the father doesn't act like an actual father, but like a self-absorbed teenager's idea of what a father might be like, ""so sure of himself without really understanding or knowing"" etc). You don't even need to see the film,  you can tell from just the trailer that the characters with ""deep and profound understanding"" will be the teenage boy and the blond teenage girl, who will ofc ""find delicate and beautiful love while no one else understands.""
