Ultron must have done something to The Hulk that the only explanation as to why he is fighting Iron Man in the Hulkbuster Armor. Still no Vision unless I missed it. Nice take on the Pinocchio theme using the minor cord. The action is incredible, the stakes are higher and this is going to have more ramifications for The Avengers. Since it's not Adamantium it has to be Vibranium and to get Vibranium deposites you need to go to Wakanda.

Also, there is a lack of Hawkeye. I doubt he will die just because he got the shaft in The Avengers, but it is possible.

It all leads up to Thanos, and he's all about death and destruction, more so than Ultron. Ultron wants to wipe out humans. Thanos wants to wipe out anything that can be considered sentient in the UNIVERSE. I just see Marvel gradually lessening the comedy (maybe except for Guardians of the Galaxy, to keep the humor in there somewhere), the closer we get to Thanos' reign of terror. Quite frankly, I'm all for it.¬†  Oh yeah, this trailer looked badass. Both trailers have had incredibly haunting music, which is refreshing.

That is why you see an angry hulk attacking Iron Man.¬†¬†In the 2nd Cap movie, she becoming Caps BFF. In this, she seems like Bruce's love interest. What a better way to fracture the Avengers and divide Hulk and Cap from Tony. It is hard to believe, Hulk would punch Thor in the 1st movie for standing next to him but let her touch him in this, if she wasn't special to him. It makes the Avengers break up more believable with Civil War coming up. ¬†Also, Scarlet is becoming an action hero and it is hard to believe, after all her Marvel work, LUCY and having Ghost in shell coming up, she just gets past over for a lead female driven Marvel movie and(after being a co-lead in TWS) be regulated to a minor character in Cap3 with the ppl that survived in TWS, Tony, Black Panther, maybe Hawkeye, Daniel Bruhl and the rest of minor super heroes that have decisions to make in the film. ¬†¬†",0,0,TheB223,MZoO8QVMxkk,0.08208616780045351,2015-01-13 04:04:14,True,True

But DC has Batman/Superman/Flash/Green Lantern/Shazam for orphans to relate to because none of them have dead parents. There's really nothing else relatable in DC. DC just has a bunch of iconic overpowered superheroes that aren't relatable at all which is why they're having so much trouble making a movie. DC heroes are GODS. Superman, Flash, Martian Manhunter & even Batman is shown in the comics & the movies to be too smart & too strong to be a normal human being. Nuff said.

I just don't trust Wheddon, his first Avengers movie disappointed me a lot, NONE-Plot nor depth, 1 bad joke per second, every character was well done in their SOLO movies but Avengers1 dumbed every character and made each less complex, it wasted all the cast and none of the plots of the previous SOLO came into play (Ironman2 excepted) and Loki,the cube and Hulk were poorly executed. The action scenes lacked, in fact I would say the Army from the Avengers is the most incompetent army ever, it was too weak. The 40 minutes spent uniting the team are pointless, and should have been spent differently, I wish Jon Favreau was directing this! I hope Avengers 2 is great because I'm a Marvel a fan, and the idea of a universe is great, but Avengers1 was executed very poorly... The SOLOS are great minus IM3 and Thor2. No MCUmovie has the depth or villians of The Dark Knigth, the X-men, Raimi's Spiderman, Apes or 007 (havent seen Cap2 hope it's as good as they say)... All I want is more DEPTH and a great villian (Loki is the best actor but the movies waste him) Hope Ultron delivers...¬†",0,0,rosvel92,MZoO8QVMxkk,0.10715053763440859,2015-01-13 06:03:02,True,True

Back to the first trailer they showed Thor in a pool of water, and in this one you see a girl taking off a cloak in front of that very same pool.   I think Thor is about to go into a ritual that allows the passage of mjolnir to another (which I believe to be Captain America)  This I believe would be the only way they could beat Ultron. By doing something he never could've calculated. Which is someone else welding Mjolnir.

Hulk is probably being controlled by Scarlet Witch,which explains the red eyes and why is has turned against his science bro Tony Stark a.k.a Iron Man. 7.Hulk is calmed down by Black Widow,due to sentimental reasons I guess?! 8.Hulkbuster Vs Hulk will definitely be this year's best combating showdown.",0,0,avitrya singh,MZoO8QVMxkk,0.044930555555555564,2015-01-13 08:26:38,True,True

I have Semi-hope for Suicide Squad and I really think they may pull out the stops for Aquaman. But as of now, movie-wise, DC feels like a one trick pony.

I'm afraid that the tone will be totally different in the actual movie.

Hulk is probably being controlled by Scarlet Witch,which explains the red eyes and why is has turned against his science bro Tony Stark a.k.a Iron Man. 7.Hulk is calmed down by Black Widow,due to sentimental reasons I guess?! 8.Hulkbuster Vs Hulk will definitely be this year's best combating showdown.",0,0,avitrya singh,MZoO8QVMxkk,0.044930555555555564,2015-01-13 15:57:28,True,True

Don't read if you aren't up to date with Ultron news.  1. Early in the story, Bruce banner is possessed by the Scarlet Witch, which turns the Hulk on the Avengers. This makes Banner feel guilt and gives for the destruction he's caused and makes him realize no one is safe. 2. While the Avengers are in Johannesburg, Black Panther will be introduced. 3. Ultron will be able to lock into any technology on Earth, making him unstoppable. In order to get rid of Ultron, they have to launch him into orbit. 4. Bruce will sacrifice himself to stop Ultron [This is where the redemption from earlier comes in]. 5. Banner going into orbit can either mean Planet Hulk[squeal], or create the bridge that will lead to a Guardians of the Galaxy/Avengers crossover. 6. Stark will feel guilt that his creation sent one of his best friends into space, prompting him to repent. This will lead to the "" Superhuman Registration Act"", which will lead to Civil War in Captain America 3.  That's it so far...

Ultron ain't messing around! Hes gonna pose a real challange to Thor. And i doubt Hulk will have a as easy go on Ultron as he did Loki. Ultron is just freaking scary... Also love the No strings them playing in the trailer. I really do hope they have it in the movie at some point. Would b kind of fun of they used it as the main theme. But i rather they use it as Ultron's theme tough. Cause The Avengers still has one of the most epic themes ever. Only rivaled by any Hans Zimmer theme. HAHA... But i do hope Age of Ultron gets an equaly epic theme. If not more epic! Guessing it'll be more dark. The Avengers i think is a more lighthearted movie. I think The MCU is moving into some dark theretory now. Clearly the Avengers won't end things on a good note. Thor will leave earth, cap and Tony will have a falling out leading to Civil War in wich they'll be fighting each other... No more friendship. And it'll probably lead to the death of Captain America seeing as hes cause is the most just. And shit will go down... Before Thanos steps up hes game i believe the MCU will allready be out of order to begin with. The heroes won't be friends. Tony will have a new team of Avengers wich he probably won't be as good with as he was the original theme. When they joined forces they became a force to fear. A team with Tony Start (least humble person alive) Doctor Strange (A natural leader) Ant Man (Probably a dick much like Tony) and who ever else... + Tony's gonna have some mental scars after this and Civil War. Age of Ultron will move us into the dark days of the MCU. So i do expect some lighthearted humor.... But this movie won't be anywhere near as lighthearted as The Avengers wich for the most case was a pretty cute and fun movie. It was in part a comdy...

2015-01-13T18:17:00,"I reckon the credits scene at the end of this will be something to do with the Illuminati. They already have the members they need; Iron Man, doctor strange had been cast, and Black Bolt is most likely on the way(except Reed Richards, but they could replace him for Black Panther seeing as he's already been cast). In the comics, when Cap discovers that Stark has been part of this secret organisation behind the avengers' and everyone else's back he starts to distrust him and the cracks for Civil War begin to show (which is a confirmed for phase 3). Hopefully if this is right, we should be seeing a Planet Hulk movie, or at least a set up for it. Just as Civil war is starting to begin, the Illuminati trick Bruce Banner into boarding a spacecraft thinking he's on a repairment mission, when in fact they've planned the coordinates for a planet inhabited only by unintelligent life-forms. This leads to Planet Hulk and then World War hulk. So this makes sense for a few reasons; the first being that we definitely know Hulk loses it in Age of Ultron and fights Stark himself, meaning he'll probably lose the trust of his team members and bring Stark to make the decision to banish him. Secondly, the Hulk doesn't play a part in Civil war, he's up in space living out the Planet Hulk storyline on Sakaar. So this would be a possible route for hulk while the Civil War goes on; then he would return to Earth when the war ends to crack some Illuminati skulls. Finally, Marvel has announced movies for all of the Illuminati characters involved in the Planet Hulk and World War Hulk storylines (apart from Mr Fantastic who can be replaced by the confirmed Black Panther as I already mentioned). You gotta wonder what the reason is for making movies for these specific characters, and one thing they all have in common is they're members of the Illuminati.

To much hulk vs Iron man in the trailers. They put a shit load of scenes of them and if the keep it up its gonna end up like Age of Extinction. The entire trailer will show the entire film.¬† 2. Its shown that Hulk will win because you can see Black Widow calming him final down (love shit?). Because hulk has them crazy eyes during the fight 1:20.

2015-01-14T00:07:24,First off this trailer looks amazing I'm so hyped for this movie I know it's gonna blow are minds!!! I am both a Marvel and DC fan so now that being said I'm really tired of this constant fight between Marvel and DC fans going back in forth like it's unnecessary I don't know why people would want to start shit on why this movie sucks or why Marvel is better then DC vice/versa like come on people were at an age where we are finally getting good comic book movies that we never thought we would see on the big screen. Back in the early 2000s we had some good and some bad comic book movies and it started to get really good when Nolan came to work on Batman Begins and The Dark Knight and then Marvel came out with Iron Man and planned out their slate of movies in their Cinematic Universe. Yea they may had miss steps with Iron Man 2 and and the Incredible Hulk but they learned from their mistakes and listen to fans so that they can do the best they can to make more better films. Yes Everybody knows Marvel Studios started their slate first and have had 10 movies come out and have proven to us that they can be a well trusted brand with their movies but that doesn't give us the right to say they suck or that DC is the better brand or that Marvel movies are overrated. I understand that everybody has their own opinion but it shouldn't give you the right to talk shit and talk about how the Marvel Cinematic Universe sucks ass and all just be proud that they made it this far and and at least have respect for them for working their ass off to create this wonderful universe. As for The DC Cinematic Universe they are just starting to build their universe up by starting with Superman. I understand that people are mixed on that movie and I respect y'all's opinions but at least they are trying. And you have to remember it was coming off of Superman Returns which at the time people didn't really think it was that good but now their opinions may have changed but for the most part Man of Steel was successful and they are now trying to really kick it off with Batman V. Superman and Suicide Squad. We may have not liked what Warner Bros./DC in the past but at least they are trying to give you the character that you want to see on the big screen cause they could have given up after 2011 Green Lantern but they didn't so let's just stop saying DC is rushing cause they are clearly not rushing. The studio obviously wants to take their time to make the best films that they can possibly make. Just be happy for DC and respect them to keep trying and working hard so that we can get the films that we fans deserve. We may not always agree with each studios decisions on what they do or plan but we should respect them and be happy that we can get the movies of are favorite characters. I don't kno what they are gonna do with Spiderman but I just hope Marvel and Sony can come to an agreement that will let us see the we slinger again on the big screen.,1,0,Justin Brad,MZoO8QVMxkk,0.19966822794691647,2015-01-14 00:07:24,True,True

I just don't want future movies to start doing bad because I love these movies and can't wait for Phase 3 and the characters in it, such as Doctor Strange, Black Panther, Captain Marvel, and Inhumans. But when a company gets so successful, they can lose sight of what got them there. And I really don't want any of these movies to fall in the: ""We're so successful so we'll make bad movies and make money anyway"" category. Besides, that hasn't worked out for certain other movies.¬†  All I'm saying is, Marvel is awesome and I want them to make movies with the same intent as Iron Man 1 from 2008: To simply make a good movie, no matter what it takes. Never try to add more than what you guys feel makes the story work JUST to please the fans. Because sometimes, trying to please the fans in certain ways can fail (Spider-Man 3 and The Amazing Spider-Man 2).

2015-01-14T15:49:28,"I find it funny that all the DC fans are saying, ""You didn't like Man of Steel's over the top destruction but you are ok with this?""  Put it into perspective. Man of Steel ended with about half of Metropolis in RUINS. The fight between the Hulkbuster and the Hulk (as shown in this trailer at least) shows a street being wrecked with some cars being blown up and thrown around, with civilians in the midst of the fight (like Man of Steel by the way). In terms of Destruction, Man of Steel surpassed even the first Avengers film.¬†  Also to those who will say I'm a Marvel fanboy, here are my favorite comic books from my own collection. I'll even make a video on my channel for those who doubt the validity.  Batman: Court of Owls Storyline (best of the New 52 IMO and he's batman. My fave DC hero) Flash Volume 1 (New 52. Mainly cause I like Captain Cold) Flashpoint (Great comic and Great animated movie) Justice League Volume 1 (Didn't care for Hal Jordan. He was more of a dick than pre 52.) Age of Ultron (The time travel aspect is confusing, but it's a good read) Avengers: Children's Crusade (Young Avengers FTW) Fear Itself: The Invincible Iron Man (Favorite Marvel Hero) Armor Wars (Iron Man....nuff said)  So yeah, I'm not a butthurt DC fanboy, nor am I just a Marvel fan.

2015-01-15T04:43:56,"Predictions for Avengers 2 just based on the trailers and a life time of reading comics:  #1 Hulk is not being mind controlled because that's nearly impossible seeing how it's one of his natural abilities as a raging monster. He is simply under an Illusion Spell by the mysterious Asgardian woman in Thor's scene. It is hard to mind control Hulk, but he's easy to trick/confuse.  #2 The Asgargian woman is Karnilla (Queen of Nornhiem). She specializes in illusion casting and has enchantments to help improve her illusion powers. I believe she traps Thor somehow to take him out of the equation and then goes and casts an Illusion spell on Banner/Hulk to see his teammates and people in the city as a threat to him. Karnilla believe no one can stop Hulk seeing how Thor is trapped/incapacitated. So Tony has to call in his secret weapon the Hulk Buster armor.¬†  #3 If an Avenger dies I think it will be Black Widow. Reason I say this is because she has been seen in enough movies to where the audience would feel the impact of the characters death. Plus this would free up a slot for Black Panther to take her place on the team. It might be Hawkeye who dies, but he really hasn't had enough screen time that the audience would feel this loss. If one of them doesn't die then I just don't see Marvel killing anyone on the team seeing how most of the super powered heroes have more movies coming out.  #4 The woman on the surgery table is Scarlet Witch. She and Quicksilver I believe will be experimented on to see how there powers work. This makes them hate humanity and decide to join Ultron to whip out the humans. Later on of course they will see the error of there ways and join the Avengers as reserve members.",0,0,ELECTRO,MZoO8QVMxkk,-0.0013888888888888963,2015-01-15 04:43:56,True,True

Tony Stark then turns to an old project termed U.L.T.R.O.N which was the brain child of both Tony and Hank Pym? Ultron units were deployed to quell the public's anger from the attacks. But during the first testing of Ultron 1, scarlet witch's powers activate which causes Ultron to malfunction and evolve into the self-aware human slayer. This could possibly explain why quicksilver and the scarlet witch are able to side with Ultron. Since they are ""miracles"" and not the dirty humans which Ultron envisioned them. Ultron convinces the witch to mind control hulk into attacking Tony Stark, which Ultron possibly claims as the cause of something? (possibly the vision of thor defeated with Cap's shield broken)  So while the Avengers are disassembled and hunting down stark for the cause of ultron, Ultron creates his army with most possibly made out of the proto-adamantium which consists primarily of vibranium. That is how Ultron comes into conflict with Wakanda.

2015-01-16T18:01:05,"Hello fans. Im just here to speculate and find out your opinions on what is going on regarding the avengers. Example at 1:03 thor looks to be channelling some lightning and shooting it at someone to me, because ive always known he can use his powers without his hammer. Remember this is part 2 so they have to always one up their powers from previous movies. But some say he looks like hes being electrocuted(<<lol) or hes having his powers taken away. What are your thoughts on this?¬†  Electrocuting the god of thunders seems highly unlikely, but we see him in what appears to be asgard, and we know that loki is impersonating odin at the moment, could he be using the all fathers powers to¬†weaken him or strip him of his powers like in thor 1? He seems to have odins staff which can do all sorts. I still think hes just shooting someone though, because the energy originated from his body and he shoots it out of the right arm towards something judging by its trajectory. Again could just be clever editing to TRICK US. Some say thor might die in this movie, maybe just temporarily, any thoughts on this?  Regarding the hulk what do you think is going on with him, hulk has never truly been evil, usually kills when attacked and his eyes looked red. Im guessing it has something to do with mind control, maybe scarlet witch? I know its not really her powers but its not the first time MCU has changed a characters powers/origin.¬†  Would like to know what others think",0,0,Prince jlee,MZoO8QVMxkk,-0.14603174603174604,2015-01-16 18:01:05,True,True

2015-01-16T18:36:33,"So let's sum up what the avengers trailer tells us: Tony had been experimenting with newer technologies prior to the 3rd movie and when his home was attacked they were mostly ruined. However, not all of it was, one suit had an advanced AI which incorporated parts of Jarvis, then using an arc reactor he had built into one of the suits, was able to begin bettering itself.¬† It manages to escape and begin causing trouble in the surrounding area. Tony reveals this is kinda sorta his fault which pisses everyone off, however, they set aside their differences and try to do the crime fighting thing. The machine perfects itself though and includes a viral imprinting system of some kind that causes the hulk to go on a rampage. Since the Hulk is pretty much unbeatable, thor gets owned, the cap gets owned and tony switches out suits and uses the hulk beater armor to fight him. Black widow manages to stop him somehow (likely cause the big guy trusts widow) and...what? they fight ultron and his new robot army and win?

I totally understand having to work around Sony and¬†Fox owning the film rights to Spider-Man, X-Men, and Fantastic Four, but Marvel could've certainly done a better job than this! Making Hank Pym a 70 year-old man and having Scott Lang be the main character of Ant-Man? Eliminating Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne from both the Avengers and the Ultron storylines, of which they are central characters in the comics? No Hank Pym as Ant-Man/Giant-Man when he's vastly more powerful and cinematically appealing at both microscopic size and 100 feet in height than goofy-ass Paul Rudd as Scott Lang? No Janet Van Dyne as The Wasp, who is not only one of the most popular female characters in Marvel comics, but is a co-founding member of the Avengers along with Hank, and would bring a much-needed female presence to the mostly male-dominated MCU?  And they're¬†making Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch Inhumans instead of mutants, which is one of the laziest, most unimaginative decisions I've yet seen? The simpler solution that fits in with Wanda and Pietro's origin story is to have them be the genetically-engineered offspring of the High Evolutionary, as they were both born at his complex at Wundagore Mountain. If they can have Thanos in the MCU, why not the Evolutionary? And having The Vision¬†and Ultron created by Tony Stark is¬†yet again more laziness on the part of Kevin Feige.

2015-02-07T07:10:22,"Seeing Hulk's (quite interesting) expression in this, I had a feeling, which led to a theory.¬†  He could very well have just saved Natasha's life at that moment.  And I mean, I'm really just speculating here, but his gaze really fascinates me. He looks as though he just had a workout (be it with the HulkBuster or an actual enemy, that is unknown) and is exhausted, and yet, he takes the time to really just stop and focus his energy on her, all the while looking strangely transfixed, but surprisingly calm at the same time. Could that be residual worry, or even relief?¬† She too seems to be considering him, although with an entirely different and very intense expression, and I may be wrong on this but she really has the face of someone who just had a brush with death... and is perfectly aware of it. Or at the very least, who is in serious shock, most likely of something that previously happened (whatever that may be). Now, there would be NO logical reason whatsoever for her to be standing that close to him. We all know there is no way, in hell, she would ever dare willingly approach him, so to see them actually facing each other is indeed peculiar. But what makes this part so intriguing to me is that she isn't running away either. Instead of just plain afraid, she rather appears troubled and deep in thought. And emotionally shaken, that's for sure. Something tells me that she may, at some point, be forced to reconsider everything she had thought she knew about the Hulk in this movie, and the perspective of seeing her finally overcome her fear of him, as well as the two getting to understand and respect each other makes me REALLY excited for this movie. :D Now I can tell there will be some awesome developpement in this, no matter what direction it takes!",0,0,Naomi LG,MZoO8QVMxkk,0.05110805860805861,2015-02-07 07:10:22,True,True

Sure, you could say that you thought that the abominations known as green lantern, Jonah hex, superman returns,  and watchmen (lukewarm not too bad) were the modern 2001 a space odysseys ( yes someone actually said that).

You may also say that you have good tv shows, comica, video games, and animated movies. But once again, we're looking at the live action department.

2015-03-09T12:03:23," Who isn't hype for this movie? In guessing it'll be the most popular movie this year. Here are some of my theories on who'll die, now I'm pretty sure they'll make it a very surprising death, meaning one of the more important characters. Hulk- Why he may die? He and Black widow will have a thing going on, and if he dies, it'll be a tragic love story.  Why may he not die? He's practically impossible to kill when he's in hulk mode. Black Widow- Same like Hulk, tragic love story.  Why may she not die? She is confirmed to be in Captain America-Civil War, and she's pretty swift. That's all my reasoning for her. Captain America- He is confirmed for another movie, but what if the movie( Civil War ) takes place in the past? He may die but thats higly unlikely to me, but honestly, he has no actual super power so he has a higher chance of dying, plus he is the most willing avenger to give up his life. Thor- In one scene, he's in a ""pool"" probably in another realm, but he is practically a ""God"" but what if the ""pool"" isn't water but something that can kill him, it's highly unlikely but it's a theory. Iron man- He's confirmed for another movie, true that he has no power, he can fight hulk, hulk is hard to kill... and has upgraded his suit, adding on to that, he is practically a ""main"" character in the movie. Hawkeye- Likely to die midway during the movie, but like i said at the beginning, Marvel probably wants a shocking death, he could die but another avenger might die too. Quicksilver and Scarlet witch-Scarlet witch, can be seen in a scene crying in the trailer, both of them were fighting with Ultron at first but in the end, you see Scarlet fighting with the avengers, maybe Ultorn has killed Quicksilver and made her switch sides. Who do you think will die?  Personally I think, Hulk or Thor... ",0,0,caitlin james,MZoO8QVMxkk,0.09390350877192982,2015-03-09 12:03:23,True,True

2015-03-27T19:50:37,"The Soul Gem (1/5 of the Infinity Stones) Is in the Visions Forehead. the Vision was created by Ultron, Ultron Created by Stark(In the movie) Stark¬† was in possession of Loki's Scepter, but Loki's scepter contained the Mind Gem, which had to mean Stark was in possession of both at one point until after Ultron was created and he stole/took the Mind Gem which he used to create Vision with...  assuming I am correct..¬†  In the final act of the movie we will have the original Avengers, Vision, Scarlet and Quicksilver, pitted against one of the final upgrade of Ultron (Adimantium/Vibranium version) and Ullyses Claw if he hasnt been defeated or killed.  Ultron will eventually be defeated, not killed off for good, but defeated for now.  Thor will die (along with someone less powerful maybe one of the twins).. Setting the story for Thor: Ragnorak  a problem will arise between Cap & Stark setting the story for Captain America: Civil War and a HUGE twist, surprise or cameo for the fate of every ones world, humans, asgardians, mutants, aliens, will be announced or fore-seen.¬†  Maybe made by the presence of a bigger villain(Thanos) or someone in connection with him.  Aside from these characters, we have stories for AntMan, Doctor Strange and Guardians Coming out in between Avengers 2 & Avengers 3(Infinity Gauntlet)  My guess is(assuming im still correct) These are introductions, additions and adaptations that will play a part in the story for Infinity gauntlet where all these characters or their actions in the films, will contribute to the battle the future group of Avengers & Guardians will have against Thanos & his group of Villains  We know Doctor Strange brings a dead hero back to life and the villains he fights in the movie will also be pitted against the then Avengers as well.  AntMan or his technology/story will help the Avengers sometime in the future or just further explains the origin of the programming Stark jump started to become Ultron.  In the upcoming Gaurdians 2, one possible villian along with the Collector and Nebula is Warlock, but it can as well be any one of the evil characters Collector has strung up in his lab, which we all know was almost completely destroyed or made a mess of in Guardians, allowing for the release or awakening of those villains along with any powerful weapons or items he had.  Thus, allowing Thanos to recruit and assemble a group to take on the heroes of the universe and kill off anyone who opposes his will. Meanwhile back on Earth, Avengers team will be introducing Black Panther officially to the roster with him fighting his own battles or whatever with maybe even Ullyses Claw making a comeback from being defeated in Age of Ultron (assuming he wasn't killed or even assuming if my theory of that movie is correct smh) There will need to be a huge surprise or event in the ending of Black Panthers battles that either will leave him as a official member of Avengers to await or join the battle against Thanos or will have a connection/lead to Captain Marvel.  Captain Marvel has always butt heads with Thanos very often, so it wouldn't be a surprise if Captain takes a lead in the battle against him, letting the rest of the Avengers to handle other villains less powerful or for them to gather the necessary means to defeat Thanos.  In which that will lead up to Avengers 4(Infinity Gauntlet 2) Where its every hero vs a villain or a couple of the universes most powerful heroes to go against Thanos as a full fledged god with a very complete Infinity Gauntlet.  NOW assuming I am correct or very close to getting the story and events right, Thanos will be defeated but not killed( maybe he will be killed idk thats up to how they change his fate in the movie version of the comics) Most of the heroes will have perished in the fight and like fallout from a nuclear war, the use the Infinity Stones or contact with, will have an affect on a group of experimented humans which will then be the rise of the Inhumans and the start of a new Marvel Phase.  Before I get any backlash I am completely aware that my theory can turn out to be completely and utterly wrong but its fun trying to piece together and figure out how these events and movies will play out :) It gives you something to think about until we actually see what happens !",0,0,Frankie V,MZoO8QVMxkk,0.054590949174282505,2015-03-27 19:50:37,True,True

There was a lot of Black Widow/Hulk romance stuff which came out of nowhere a little but it worked pretty well. Hawkeye has a wife and kids which he was keeping secret. Ultron is an alright villain but was lacking in character beyond generic Whedon quipping. At the end Cap assembles a bunch of new members for the Avengers including Scarlet Witch, Falcon, War Machine and one more if I'm remembering correctly. Quicksilver dies saving Hawkeye. It ends setting up Thor seeking Ragnorok and Cap doubting Stark's ability to resist tampering futher with the world, and Hulk goes AWOL on his own.

2015-04-26T03:59:31,"Warning: Spoilers!      The movie begins with the Avengers retrieving Loki's staff from a still existing Hydra base. Tony uses iron man robots (like in Ironman 3) to evacuate a nearby city. People reject the robots. The Avengers get the staff and return to the Avengers Tower. Tony and Bruise discover a way to create artificial intelligence, and Tony and Bruce create a new intelligence to implement into Ultron, who would work along side the Avengers. Later that night a party would be hosted in celebration of retrieving the staff.      Ultron awakes without a body, Jarvis notices he is malfunctioning and acts him to reboot, but Ultron rejects Jarvis's request and kills him. Ultron implants himself in one of the iron man robots.      After the party is over, you see the Avengers sitting down talking and telling stories. They all attempt to lift Thor's hammer. After each one of them tried, Thor tells them they're simply not worthy to wield the hammer. Then Ultron walks into the room, limping. Ultron explains his purpose and the only way to peace is the Avenger's extinction. Several Ultron Bots fly the the walls and attack the avengers. Thor throws his hammer at Ultron, destroying him. Ultron escapes into the Internet. The Avengers discover that Jarvis is dead, they blame Tony.     We see Quick Silver and Scarlet Witch walk into a chapel, in the center Ultron sits on a throne with his new armor. He explains his purpose once again and asks them why they let the Avengers take the staff.     The Avengers track them down to a pear. Ultron, Quick Silver, and Scarlet Witch take Vibranium to make Vision, but are caught by  the Avengers. The Avengers attack Ultron, QS and SW. During the fight, SW puts several of the Avengers under a trance. When she does it to Hulk, he rampages to a nearby city. Because all of the Avengers are either wounded are under a trance, Tony uses the Hulk Buster to stop hulk. Tony stops Hulk but destroys nearly half the city (possibly leaving a reason for a civil war) News spreads, and Bruce is endangered of getting arrested. They fly to a safe house and stay there for a few weeks     Ultron brakes into the Avengers tower and uses a regeneration machine and uses the Vibranium to create Vision. SW scans the Vision body and discovers Ultron's true plans. Instead of getting rid of just the Avengers, he planned to get rid of all of humanity. SW and QS betray Ultron. The Avengers show up at the tower to stop Ultron. Ultron flees but with Black Widow. Tony and Bruce discovers Jarvis was still alive and fled into the Internet as well. Tony decides to put the conscious of Jarvis in the lifeless Vision body, but Captain America walks in to tell them not to do that because what happened to Ultron might happen to Vision. They argue until Thor appears from the sky and brings Vision to life with an mind infinity stone. Vision reveals to the Avengers he is on their side and wishes to stop Ultron because he is the real threat, not the Avengers.     Ultron his bots invade Nova Scotia, Ultron raises a piece of the city into the sky, he plans to use it as a metaphor for a meteor and plans to drop it to the Earth wiping out humanity. Ultron does just that, taking the city into the sky, but the Avngers are there to stop him. After fighting off the bots, ten helicarrier shows up and takes the people of the city, the Avengers take advantage of the fact that the people have been taken out of the city and destroy it, but before that, Ultron steals jet begins firing at the Avengers, Hawkeye  was going to risk his life to save a little boy, but before Uktron shot him, quick silver used himself as a shield for Hawkeye and dies, Scarlet kills Ultron by removing his ""heart."" Thor destroys the city as if fell to the Earth.     You see vision and the last Ultron bot standing on a hill. Vision questions the bot and then kills the bot, destroying Ultron once and for all.   The after credit scene is Thanos picking up the goblet which is missing all the Infinity Stones, as he smirks at the camera. (This is literally 5 seconds)   If some of this didn't make sense, it's either I forgot or I just have poor writing skills. Also, some information was excluded from this, so.

That robot looked lifted right from Terminator Salvation. Captain America that actor did not play this role well. Samuel Jackson again plays the all-knowing omnipotent wise man who talks down to everyone.   The worst part of this movie was that it didn't take itself NEARLY seriously enough. Tons of cheesy and goofy punch-lines¬†all during¬†dramatic moments, which took so much away from it. Never seen so much corny humor in a comic-book movie like EVER.   I would give the action a 10/10. As far as acting, no one really was that good except the Natasha woman. Wayyy too much corny dialogue. I mean I realize it is supposed to be a fun movie... The Hulk, most Iron Man movies, the first Avengers and Captain America all felt way more like true full-fledged comic book movies. I felt nothing for the actors and with the cheap one-liners, seems like they wanted to appeal to everyone. Wouldn't have been surprised if it would have been rated PG.",0,0,1RonBurgundy1,MZoO8QVMxkk,0.1959896584896585,2015-05-16 03:48:13,False,True

2017-01-08T05:31:22,"For those wondering who ""kitty"" is, I'll explain:  kitty0706 was a YouTuber from long ago, famous for creating GMod videos. His most popular work was a GMod video called ""Team Fabulous 2"", which to this day has garnered over 19 million views.  I've no clue when he was first diagnosed with cancer, I think it was 2012, but his leukemia grew serious and he was forced to spend more time away from YouTube. He died on January 25, 2015, and boy, I remember that day fairly well. I was sitting in my high school science classroom (that's where I ate at lunch with my friends) and was scrolling through some stuff, and decided to watch a kitty0706 video. So I type his name into the internet browser, and it comes up with a reddit post about his death. I screamed ""WHAT THE F---"" and everybody in the room turned and stared at me. I had only been a fan of kitty for about a year, maybe even less, but I couldn't believe it. I thought (and I think everyone else did) that he was pretty much done with leukemia and he was doing okay, but it all kind of sprung on us...  Looking back, I actually think kitty0706 was one of the most sane and kindhearted people on YouTube (especially with the drama going on right now), and many memorial videos that came out afterwards from friends and acquaintances seemed to portray that too. Regardless, this felt like a huge loss for a lot of TF2 and GMod video fans.  Apparently, this was the last video kitty0706 liked on his account, so that's why so many confused people (myself included) wound up from his channel. If you want to see if you'd like any of his stuff, it's kind of an acquired taste, but try Team Fabulous 2 and the Moments with Heavy series.
