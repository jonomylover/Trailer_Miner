Look at the past 3-4 years, look at all of the gay/transgender/feminist movies that are being made and are being nominated for awards at all of the liberal award shows. Moonlight just won best picture at the academy awards. The main character was black and gay. Check and check. They basically had to make the movie Best Picture since last year they were roasted for not having ANY movie nominated for Best Picture with an African American in it. Check the fan reviews of Moonlight on imdb, rotten tomatoes, etc. The movie gets very mediocre reviews from fans. The liberal critics vote differently but the fans didn't think it was great. Hollywood is trying to tell you what's acceptable, how to think, and what is good. Remember all of those youtube videos with every relevant Hollywood actor telling you that ""you must vote for Hillary Clinton, don't vote for Trump"". They made a video every week and put it on youtube's trending page. I watch this trailer and think: ""Well, there's Hollywood for you!"".

No shaky cam, no intense montage sequence... Plus Theron coming back to action since Mad Max: Fury Road is a good sign. If she can pull off her own identity instead of being a John Wick, then MAYBE it'll be more than a ""female"" action movie. She has to be an action hero, not a female action hero: she has to be on par with what's already established in cinemas. That's TRUE equality. But first, the movie will have to be good. If it's not, then she'll be a ""John Wick"" pretender. That's how it works.

Big muscles can do great things but sometimes people don't know how to use them. Put someone who lifts weights with no fighting experience in a fight and they probably won't do very well because muscle does not equal agility. If you look at Bruce Lee movies, you will notice that there aren't a lot of cuts made in his fight scenes - that is because he is ACTUALLY fighting. He actually has the agility and skills to make those quick movements and think fast. Most actors today don't have to do that because they can cheat it with lots of cuts and stuff. And look at Bruce Lee. Did he have huge, rippling muscles? Nope. He was toned, but he didn't look anything like Mark Wahlberg.

But it is a common belief among most people,  especially men who have witnessed smaller men dominate larger men. Her moves appear slower because they are, and her fighting style capitalizes on that. Because she is a woman, and smaller, her adversaries are more likely to underestimate her and assume her attacks won't hurt them. Knowing this, she takes the time to put real force behind her attacks and ultimately gain the upper hand. We are all still human.

Action and direction and cinematography, although I will never understand why the fuck directors and producers and studio hacks insist on begining at the fucking end and jumping in time to supposedly make a dense plot even more complex. Absolutely no one under the age of 50 is going to get the subtleties of the US/USSR/East German thing so they're going to rely totally on the darker than should-be fight scenes, which are marvelous. So right off the fucking bat you lose word of mouth, relevance, generational ambiguity and everyone but violent american men who dream of Charlize sticking her toes up their asses. Americans are so fucking stupid these days that they don't know anything about history, especially their own. In fact if there's not an open beer or bag of salty chips on the horizon they literally can't get their fat asses off the fucking couch.  Trying to sell a Cold War action flick in America is like opening a ghost pepper taco stand in hell.

Also won‚Äôt fail to mention the fact that most hollywood fight scenes never flow properly if you break them down. Most Hollywood fight scenes will only show half of the movement and all of the impact; they also tend to have a shit ton of impossible moves that involve a lot of spinning made to confuse the eye and assume everything is moving faster when it reality it‚Äôs just a lot of things moving. Atomic blonde does something different for that. It goes for wide un-choppy cuts. And movements that are definitely ‚Äúmore realistic‚Äù than the standard norm.

Maybe I just didn't understand it I dunno (I feel like the movies that get the best reviews by critics are the ones that I simply can't relate to for whatever reason whereas the movies that get the worst reviews, I actually like those). I had no idea what was going on the entire time. The plot was nonexistent, the pacing was really slow, the dialogue was sketchy, the acting was stilted, there were too many scenes of the main character smoking & drinking (as if that's the only thing that makes you a badass) and there weren't enough fight scenes (I went into this thinking it was gonna be like a Fast & Furious movie with non-stop action. Boy was I wrong! And since a lot of people are comparing this film to John Wick, it makes me not want to watch John Wick because that film is probably just as bad). I really wanted to like this movie because we need another epic female action flick, plus, Charlize Theron is an amazing actress. But let's face it, Angelina Jolie is like the only female who's actually good at making action flicks (plus, she probably has better screenwriters and directors for her films). Every other actress pales comparison. Anyway, I kinda regret paying to see Atomic Blonde but at the same time ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" was even worse (as was the  ""Carrie"" remake a few years ago and ""Hercules"" with The Rock) so it's not like Atomic Blonde was the worst movie I paid to see (plus, I recently paid to see ""Wish Upon"" which was cheesy but I knew that going in. I purposefully paid to see a cheesy teen horror movie and I'm doing it again with ""Polaroid"" later this month. With Atomic Blonde, as well as PPZ, Carrie & Hercules, I actually expected it to be good but it just wasn't).",3,1,chilvari,nI7HVnZlleo,-0.012083333333333324,2017-08-04 21:15:52,False,True
