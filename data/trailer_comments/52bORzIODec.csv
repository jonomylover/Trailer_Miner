2018-12-28T18:57:29,"Here’s the full story:  A good christian white family is struck with unfortunate luck, when their son falls in ice that all could’ve been avoided had the boy listened to the old man telling him to get off the ice.  Anyways the only black guy in town, who also happens to be the only atheist in town, comes to the rescue in the nick of time. But ya know it was god that actually saved the boy, because if it was a black atheist man responsible for saving the boy’s life, there wouldn’t be a story.  Soon the boy is sent to the hospital where they speak to the all-state guy, who also happens to be the only other black guy in town. He tells them they’re doing everything they can, but it doesn’t look good for their son. So the mother reminds him that even though he is a professional he clearly doesn’t know anything about her son’s health and she’s the real expert.   Eventually the boy lives not because of first responders or the doctors that spent countless hours working with him, but because of GOD. And the mother realizes she now possesses super powers to summon GOD to her aid at any time.   Then a group of strangers wait outside for the family to leave the hospital, so they can all sing Kumbaya together.   P.S. Remember it wasn’t the help of two black guys that helped brought her son back to life. IT WAS GOD. Why do people even bother with hospitals anymore when you can just pray and have GOD perform miracles?",25,31,Rogue Tide,52bORzIODec,0.06314102564102562,2018-12-28 18:57:29,True,True

BUt its not much of a christian school if they act so cruel, i later left after a year of begging my mum to let me switch schools. Im now at the best school i could ask for, quality teaching and nice students.

Hell is what I had gone through as a young child( many stuff happened).... even thou people say his not real I stand firm to confirm that he is real. Many things about this world are real- and it's pure crazy stuff but God loves us. In 2017 I received my very own prophecy from a prophetess and she said stuff that penetrated me- I was shook... talking about my birth mom's death and all .. how God will use me as light just like many others..😢 laugh all you want it's ok. I didn't get to the details about my life cause am not ready to. It was sooo painful. At my current age-18... I look back and know that i had gone through sooo much but only one person remembered me. I believe what I saw and what I know is I am of Christ for he saved me again... be blessed  Ps dont believe people who discourage but find out the truth for your own understanding..

Not everyone believes in god and that’s ok I myself am an atheist but if this was your loved one you would be praying to whatever or whoever you could pray to so don’t come here with your negativity .

My husband had a massive brain stroke at 40 years old  and has been in a comatose state for 7 months. He only had a 5% of living and he's fighting to come back. I pray every single day that he wakes up for me and our children.

2019-01-20T03:11:41,"I'm a Christian and I can confidently say I hate almost all Christian films I've seen. They are made by Christians for Christians. they paint atheism as the enemy when that is absolutely not the case. They spew the same generic ""God loves you"" type themes but never fully explore the depth of God or the reality of his presence. Their sole purpose is to further the divide between Christianity and atheism by showing the same general themes with absolutely nothing new to say. Like if I was an atheist watching these movies I would be so appalled by religion and how ""in your face"" these movies are. These movies make it look like once you're a Christian you don't have any issues because everything will eventually be good because God is good. I agree with that to an extent. Yes, if you are a Christian and die that way then you will go to heaven for eternity which is, of course, a happy ending. But God isn't just gonna not allow any bad to happen to you. Like every traumatic incident and all the pain I've felt in my life have made me the person I am. I know that through the bad and the good God is still God. he is Good and merciful and powerful and forgiving. For any of you Christians out there, I don't know the exact passage, but Jesus comes to Thomas and tells him he has resurrected and all that stuff. Thomas doubts him and Jesus tells him to put his fingers in his pierced hands. This means that Jesus's spiritual body still has the scars of his pain and the trials he went through. There's power in suffering. I think Christians need to start understanding and believing that before we start preaching this ooy gooy lifestyle where all is unicorns and rainbows when all the disciples were persecuted for their beliefs (most to the point of death)  and Peter was crucified on an upside-down cross because he didn't think he was worthy enough to die the death of his savior. In conclusion, I just think there needs to be more 'realistic' Christian movies that show the actual life of real devoted Christians that choose not to just say the words and then use the church as a status or facade. We need movies that don't try to act like any other religions or beliefs are our enemy. We are called to love so why do our movies not show what a genuine loving relationship with the lord is like. Sorry that this was so long. It's just this is something I'm very passionate about and I needed to get off my chest. It just angers me to see movies like this that do the opposite of what they intend to do. In their pretentiousness, they divide more than they unify.",85,30,Ryan Schlaud,52bORzIODec,0.1112809917355372,2019-01-20 03:11:41,True,True

The earth could be completely destroyed by HIS word alone and the fact that HE doesn’t “zap” those who refuse to acknowledge HIM shows HIS patience as well. But, there is coming a day when HE will deal with ALL who mock, ridicule, scoff and laugh. Frankly, I DO NOT believe that there are “atheists”  - these are ppl who KNOW that GOD exist but they refuse to acknowledge HIM.  As in the days of Noah, so shall it be in the Last Days.... man hasn’t changed.....they haven’t, for the most , learned anything.  GOD does exist and HE sent JESUS to rescue our souls by HIS atoning sacrifice and, I believe, GOD takes it serious when mankind REJECT this “gift of grace & mercy”.  The choice is ours....choose THE WAY, TRUTH, LIFE  ( all wrapped up in one person , J E S U S).  One day this world is going to get exactly what they want...a earth without GOD/JESUS & HIS followers. That event/moment & day is going to be “something else”. Even so, Come, LORD JESUS.  Maranatha 2019. MY HOPE IS BUILT ON NOTHING LESS THAN JESUS’ BLOOD & RIGHTEOUSNESS. I DARE NOT TRUST THE SWEETEST FRAME BUT WHOLLY LEAN ON JESUS’ NAME. WHEN HE SHALL COME WITH TRUMPET SOUND, OH MAY I THEN IN HIM BE FOUND.

Last January 2019 i told God in desperation that i want him to healed me. I said if i don't feel pain anymore in February that means you're the one who healed me. So i read the bible of God's promises regarding healing. And now for the first time in a long time i never have pain. I praise Jesus! I was extremely happy that he heals me.

True stories don’t happen based on fake things. God is real, and don’t say he isn’t. If he isn’t, who created   knowledge? The universe? Man? Woman? Animals? Love? Hatred? Who created those things if god isn’t real? I’m not spreading my religion, but the undeniable truth. We didn’t just come from nowhere people. Get that into your heads! To all of you non-believers, I hope you realize that you are most likely a child who doesn’t know much about anything. I, too, am a child. A 13 1/2 child. Throughout my 13 years on this planet, I have noticed many things that are just scientifically Impossible, but possible if it was created by a holy being with inhumane powers. If you just believe, the world will forgive you and god will relinquish you of all your sins. I’ll put it this way. We know god is real, and we know we are real. But, if god isn’t real, then are we real? Evidence gives us both answers. You just need to find it. Not just any evidence, *the truth.*",0,0,Clarkexedits,52bORzIODec,0.06018518518518517,2019-02-09 01:12:31,True,True
2019-02-09T01:28:36,"17 miracles and The Cokeville Miracle are probably the best Christian movies. But i like to watch others. Just to see that God doesn't abandon people. That He has a plan for them as long as they are willing to trust in Him. God DOES exist. But to actually know you have to study the bible or any other religious book diligently.. Then pray and the answer will come. In Gods own time. 1 day for us is like 1000 for Him. He has the time to care for each and every one of you. He loves you. He wishes that He could end all our pain. But we must endure to the end. Then, if you have, you can recieve everything. You will live with him for eternity. I know that each and every one of you has the potential to make it. I know Christ and our Heavenly Father love us.  But science does do things too. God can't do everything for us. We have to go through our own experiences to learn and grow. God has blessed us with emense knowledge. But His knowledge is greater. He knows what is best for us. If He decides it is time, then it is time. If He has a plan for us then He will let us live if we choose to. We all have our free choices to make.   Can I just clarify something?  You will all be resurrected no matter the choices you make. You will gain the power to live again because you followed God's plan and not Satan's. You will all inherit one of the 3 kingdoms of glory. The telestial kingdom is for people who are murderers and others like them. Terrestrial kingdom is for people who are good but haven't been baptized in the right way or at all. In this kingdom Christ will be in your presence. The Celestial kingdom is for people who have received the fulness of the gospel. They live with christ and god. They will recieve God's powers to create life, create worlds, and have endless knowledge. There is no Heaven and Hell senario. This is why God has the perfect plan for us.

Using a dyaislis machine, they was able to thaw him out & warm his blood, as well as revive him.  What astounded everyone was that the child suffered no detectable brain damage, which the medical staff attributed to the cold.

I used to believe in God, but I converted into an Atheist over 12 years now just because I have been hell since the day I was born and it kept getting worse until I stopped believing.  Anywho, even though I am an atheist,  I still respect other religions, but I like to give opinions in a respectful manner, without manipulating or putting someone down because they don't have the same religion as me.

That is what's entirely different then modern day accounts of people being prayed back from the dead, the accounts we here about are people who are given emergency medical treatment within anywhere from 15- 30 minutes after their heart stops and in this case the person was submerged in ice cold water and remember the saying for hypothermia victims "" they aren't dead until they are warm and dead"" . Apparently due to very cold temperatures Smith avoided very much damage to his brain and was never really brain dead, once you reach the medical criteria of brain death there is no coming back. I don't believe people understand the difference between coma, vegetative and prolonged vegetative state and brain death. There is a rule of thumb we should keep in mind , under normal conditions after about six minutes without any blood-flow brain cells begin to die and there will be brain damage after ten minutes brain death occurs.

I am a Christian, and my brother was very sick for a long time, and we prayed and prayed but he didn’t get better for years. People told us that we just needed to have more faith, that all we needed to do was pray harder. This is not to tear down this family’s beautiful story, this is just to say to all you who are suffering and who feel like God doesn’t hear you, you do not just need to “pray harder” or whip up some extra faith.

2019-04-17T17:36:16,"It is sad they use song in the movie from apostate and sensual Hillsong Church, which has no respect for the holy innocence of Jesus Christ, God the Son. Head pastor, Brian Houston, shielded his father, Frank Houston, from being convicted of his pedophilia crimes. He was adamant he didn’t want any kind of police investigation into his father’s vile homosexual behaviors with children. He knew the facts for 15 years, holding his silence; this he conceded when interviewed.  And is it any wonder Houston will not condemn homosexuality nor will Carl Lentz, the main pastor of the Hillsong fellowship in New York City, a sister church to Sidney’s Hillsong. Both churches welcome the sexually deviant into their fellowships.  Hillsong in Australia had a homosexual song leader who also held Bible studies for the church in his home and his partner’s. They had planned a marriage in Hillsong Church. Finally, after many outcries, the homosexual was removed from his position.  God commands Christians not to associate with the sexually deviant who call themselves believers; 1 Corinthians chapter 5. The restriction also includes the financially dishonest, the drunkards, those who covet, those who worship idols or false deities. These evil people are to be expelled from the church if they do not repent. A little leaven of sin in the church pollutes the entire congregation as clearly seen in this chapter.  Carl Lentz is a favorite of Oprah Winfrey—a new age promoter and calls people to follow a false Jesus. Once, on her show, he stated you do not have to be a Christian to have a relationship with Jesus.  Lentz’s church is known for the famous who attend. He refused to call abortion sin until there was an outcry. This apostate man does not tell people they have to be born again to be saved through Jesus Christ, being washed clean of all filth and made into a new creation. He will not say you are going to the lake o fire if you are not saved.  Walking in newness of a holy life which is a life of holy separation, appears to evade him.  He is a worldly, rock and rolling man full of a false gospel, manufactured to please many ears. Speaking out of both sides of his mouth when it comes to Christianity is the norm. In many instances, he has allowed the world to squeeze him into its mold.  From Christian News: “Photos of Lentz with the soon-shirtless Bieber slamming shots together at a bar have been circulating online—the latest among a number of controversies involving Hillsong NYC, which also raised eyebrows last year after its youth leader appeared as the “naked cowboy” during a women’s conference.” Ladies were dancing sexy and sleazy.   And there have been posted photos, some very questionable, of the two, including one photo with Lentz shirtless, exposing some of his private area and Bieber in very short shorts—it is most disgusting and vile!  We must remember, the Scriptures command us not to allow false teachers in the church. These are those who add and subtract from the Bible, perverting its teachings. The book of Jude warns us not to allow licentiousness into any fellowship. Licentiousness removes morally upright laws and this includes a call for modest dress.  Bono, the man who made famous the coexist logo, which displays Islam, Judaism, and Christianity as one, also attends Lentz’s church. Bono has no problem dressing like satan when he performs, which he says he enjoys … that is revealing his satanic side.  Christians please be vigilant and alert to the vileness of our day and come out and be separate, not fearing being shunned!

They know what feeling people wanna get when they are sitting in the hall of a theater,that's what they give you so you would believe.

Because it's from hollywood, there are so many movies base on true story we don't even know it's true or not but we will believe, why? Because they are from Hollywood, they said so!

2019-04-20T01:26:22,"New research shows that cold water drowning victims can be brought back to life as long as two hours after they drown if the right steps are taken. That means even if the heart has stopped beating and the victims' brains aren't getting the oxygen we all need to stay alive. Once the body detects an impending cold-water immersion, it attempts to thwart the cold and preserve blood flow to the brain and internal organs. The heart rate slows down, decreasing oxygen demand. And capillaries in the hands and feet begin to tighten, squeezing blood to the core of the body and brain, where it’s needed most.  That response gives cold water drowning victims the equivalent of a second life — if rescuers know how to treat them. Research shows the key is to call 911 and start CPR immediately, without trying to warm the body. Once victims reach the hospital, doctors can slowly warm and restore blood flow, often bringing the dead back to life.  And the difference between life and death for cold water and regular drowning victims is more than a matter of minutes. Dr. Robert Helm, a New Hampshire cardiac surgeon tells of a 3-year-old girl who was resuscitated after nearly 50 minutes. And it’s not just young children who get a second chance in cold water drownings. Helm also knows of a 32-year-old woman who was not resuscitated until nearly 80 minutes after her drowning. Being brought back to life might seem like the amazing part. But it’s the other part that’s truly miraculous: both victims recovered without a brain damage.  Why is that amazing? Drowning isn’t just an event that causes death. Often, drowning survivors suffer brain damage because of the amount of time their brains go without oxygen. That’s why more than 50 percent of drowning victims who survive require hospitalization. And for every child who drowns, three suffer brain damage, according to the Swims Foundation.  So as spring slowly comes this year, bringing with it the inevitable falls through ice, remember that cold water drownings don’t have to be a death sentence, nor a debilitating trauma. They just need to be treated differently than regular drownings. Doing so could give someone a second chance at life.",4,20,Thomas Marquez,52bORzIODec,0.00994436849700008,2019-04-20 01:26:22,False,True

2019-05-01T10:39:58,I don't understand why this is a big deal. People have survived drownings like this before. Another true story an Italian boy (14 year old) survived after 42 min. underwater. Youth and cold water seem to be the tie of higher survivability in drownings. Is it because God was attached to the movie that made it a story worth telling? There was a baby who drowned in cold water and was under for 2 hours yet no movie i wonder why that is?. I think using God as a selling point is the reason why this movie was made.,0,0,v c,52bORzIODec,-0.03333333333333334,2019-05-01 10:39:58,False,True
