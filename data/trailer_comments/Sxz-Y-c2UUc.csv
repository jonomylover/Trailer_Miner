I think that's the main ""persecution"" (quote on quote) Christians face now a days, whilst in the Middle East it's much more physical and more heart wrenching to see and hear. I'm a Christian and while I'm not being persecuted physically (thank God) it still hurts when I hear folks get insulted for their faith, even if they're not talking to me directly.

I am a Christian and I do believe that culture has a tendency to hate on Christianity more than other religions purely for the fact that it's radical and has no room for other beliefs. What they don't understand or don't want to accept is that the only kind of religion that can love is one that does not allow others to believe lies. These movies are lies in a way, they show non Christians to all be hateful and rude and ignorant. This is not what the Bible or Jesus taught to do. Love your enemies, pray for those who persecute you, and do this with gentleness and kindness. This isn't a legal battle or a contest, you don't need propaganda. It's a battle of spiritual nature, of love vs pride. The individual needs of each person in the world who feel the pain and valueless side of life without knowing that God made them unique and loves them because of who they are not what they can do or what they have.

I am a devout Christian. I have a sister who is an open lesbian and I love her the same as I would if my sister were straight. There are Christians out there who would persecute me for that, and there are also nonChristians who would persecute me for that. With that being said it's pretty safe to say that no matter what you believe in the way you choose to behave should have nothing to do witg your religion. More specifically, the way that some Christians behave shouldn't reflect ALL Christians, just as the way certain homosexuals behave, shouldn't reflect ALL homosexuals and so on and so forth. God gives us the choice to excercise free will and I can assure you that anyone who tells you that you're going to hell will find themselves in hell ass well. Many people just in general tend to use the bible as a means to bully others. They twist the word of God to support their own ideologies. The fact is that God simply commanded us to love one another...period. God didn't say ""Love your brother if he's straight. Love your sister, but she can't be black. Love your brother as long as he believes what you believe in."" I think as Christians we should get back to focusing on what God wanted from us. Simply put...we need to love each other. No exceptions and no questions asked. So if you are a nonbeliever, and you are reading this, I apologize on the behalf of all the Christians who have failed to see the purpose of the religion they claim to be rallying for.

2015-11-09T18:19:52,"Preying for someone is not solving the problems. You're human and they are human; help one another should be the line, all we have is each other. Dumb ass movie about some Christian war that is none existent within the US. This is because the youth is no longer listening to bullshit (they want actual change and facts; not the promise of change and lies. We all are still treated like shit and religious idiots say prey for one anther but do nothing else. Really come on) so they aren't going to Church and are becoming more involved in politics (they don't have money to run off and give to a nonexistent entity that is controlled by humans that do nothing to change their outcome nor their income). Ass hat politicians can no longer hid behind religion they have to actually think of change that benefit the nation's citizens and act on those changes or lose their jobs.   I love this move away for passive thinking towards actually moving on logically thoughts. Too many corrupt, pedophilia, money hungry jackasses are within religion. None are perfect; religion is ran by humans, so of course it is going to be flawed. Actual religious wars are fought outside the US today because of the greatest brainwashing from idiots that can not think outside their religion to even care for each other (why is this movie not about that. I suppose it is too real and paints religion in a bad light. Also would make one religion mad at the other; Love your neighbors with a gun). Religion has been used to control,  destroy, make some other motherfucker rich, and is still used in that form ( I even thought about being a religious con artist myself, but I just can't do it. Yeah it would make me rich to promise invisible bullshit, but it would only benefit me not everyone). So why even make a movie about some shit that does not matter? No one cares about religion it is no longer that which solves a damn thing; it causes it.   Government and getting involved with government is a problem solver. This movie may also be an attempt to keep the already docile and out of touch and out of government. Yeah Republican nut bags are religious and they get involved. Yeah right, their politicians paint what they are by spewing vile shit about other races and yelling God wherever they go. They never come up with any strategies on change nor helping the minority (that includes most of the poor white republicans that hate everything) because the base of their political party is filled with bigots, racists, and closed minded ""religious"" nut bags. So the politicians just do a song and dance with no promises.   The free tax known as religion has not done shit for anyone but it has forced its brainwashing on many people; controlling how they interact, think, and get involved with actual change within their country. How is someone racists towards someone; call themselves a whatever religion they belong to, when you're meant to love one another? It doesn't make sense. Blacks, Hispanics, and Arabs are treated like shit (including by their own race of people) within this country and many others. If you're not the majority of some nation the religion goes out the door and the majority wins representation within government and in the job market. What do the minority have that promises it will represent them? Stupid ass way of getting representation when religion has no power to do shit for them. So more and more minorities; I hope, are getting involved with government and moving away from religion. It is the only true way to have representation. Religion has not done anything for the minority lately. You could also get representation by controlling a huge sum of US debt. Then your people may actual get hired for jobs and also be able to buy land where they may have not been able to do in the past. The Chinese and the wealthy got it right. They did not turn to religion they turned to money. Look at them now. Advanced their country or social status to be somebody important (seem to have forgotten to also educate some of their citizens on behavior and how to keep that money) with the use of government, resources, and US Debt.  I bet this movie will not address anything that is actual fact because idiots belong to a majority and they probably made this shit. They must follow the group or be labeled something that hurts their feelings. You either still believe in dumb shit that is created by man and can not think logically that the shit does not make sense. No one truly practices what it preach. A better option would have been lets change it to fit with today's world. I am judging because a ""sinner"" that know people's ""sins"" can judge people and send them to prison. So I am judging the lunacy of do nothing but have faith because GOD is going to make it happen attitude. Get up, get educated, and start doing shit if you are serious enough to be about change. I personally do not give a shit because it is an uphill battle to change a person's mind even when you give them logically reason as to why they should reconsider.",0,0,1Post Daily,Sxz-Y-c2UUc,0.025728862973760914,2015-11-09 18:19:52,True,True

Of course it's going to be strongly biased! So if you aren't open to the values of Christianity, then you probably won't like the movie. Pure Flix is a CHRISTIAN entertainment company that makes CHRISTIAN films. That being said, however, this one puts to much pity on Christians in my opinion and makes them look way to victimized.

So many people have become so judgmental that they don't give anything a chance anymore, to enjoy a movie you don't just have to agree with it, it also has to be a movie worth watching. All these people are saying ""This movies a joke, and I'm Christian"" well if you don't like the movie that's fine but it's hard to sound Christian when you're just shunning it away. And for you non-religious people, what's it matter to you? You don't want to watch the movie? Then don't, easy as that. There is no need to be hating on it simply for being a movie about God ""oh, but these kinds of movies are ruining society and brainwashing people"" if they go to watch the movie, it's because they WANT to, they're most likely already ""brainwashed"".

You can quote the Prophet Muhammad all day in school, or Buddha as well as many other religious figures, and yet if someone quotes any one from the Bible, it is seen as Christians trying to force their believes on others.  I find it truly sad when Not just America but any nation that claims liberty and freedom as staples of society gets to the point when people are forced to keep who they are private because it may offend some one.  Who is more offensive?  The person who simply incorporates things that are part of who they are in their every day life, or the person that hates that characteristic (Religion in this case) so much that they insist that the other person should not be allowed to express that part of their life in public in any way.  if that characteristic  was sexual orientation or something along the lines of transgender, then it would be a whole other story, it would be seen as bigotry, and prejudice, but when it is Christianity (which if you are a christian then it is who you are not something you claim to be) people dont look at both sides of the coin.",0,0,foxta14,Sxz-Y-c2UUc,-0.008333333333333323,2016-02-12 15:41:10,True,True

Jesus said, ""Whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart."" Have you looked with lust? Will you be guilty on Judgment Day? If you have done those things, God sees you as a lying, thieving, blasphemous, adulterer at heart. The Bible warns that if you are guilty you will end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He sent His Son to suffer and die on the cross for you. You broke God's Law, but Jesus paid your fine. That means He can legally dismiss your case. He can commute your death sentence: ""For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life."" Then He rose from the dead and defeated death. Please, put your trust in Jesus alone for your salvation (and Jesus alone, not your good works) and repent (change your mind) today, and God will grant you the gift of everlasting life. Then read your Bible daily and obey it.  (All good works should come from love and not a legalistic manner",0,3,coMITCH Art,Sxz-Y-c2UUc,0.21071428571428572,2016-02-22 03:49:04,True,True

I don't have a problem with people believing in gods but I feel this is an insult to Atheists, treating us like we're the bad guys and Christians are the ones being oppressed, persecuted which is far from the truth. United States of America is based on religious freedom, secular values and you're free to practice your religion whatever it is, whether it is Catholicism, Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Paganism or non-religion such as Deism, Atheism or Humanism. Nobody is saying you can't practice your religion, your Christian faith. I feel like this movie is giving people the wrong message, propaganda and hating on Atheists just because we don't believe in gods. Really, religion doesn't belong in public schools, politics or government at all. However students can have their own private, silent prayers and Bibles but it's the teachers, school officials can't lead a prayer or preach in classrooms because they're only there for teaching education and because public schools are funded by the government where religion does not belong at all but at home, private schools or churches yes.",2,0,The Star Treker,Sxz-Y-c2UUc,-0.07878787878787877,2016-03-04 22:12:41,True,True

2016-03-13T18:44:48,"Here's the intriguing thing for me:   The central passage of Scripture in this movie is the passage where Jesus commands his followers to ""love"" their enemies and ""pray for those who persecute"" them (Matthew 5:43-48; see also Luke 6:27-38).   The ethic being advanced in these sayings of Jesus is one that is sorely needed during this current election year in the US: People too often have been advancing the terrible ethic ""hate your enemies,"" and people have even been identifying those who *aren't* their enemies as their enemies.   Notice Jesus' statement here as Matthew presents it: ""For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors [a class of people who often took advantage of people] do the same? And if you greet only your siblings, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?"" (Matthew 5:46-47).  ^ This doesn't sound to me like Jesus is promoting a persecution complex. The call to responsibility in this ""love your enemies"" passage in the Sermon on the Mount is not placed by Jesus on the *enemies* of his followers—Jesus is address his followers here, not their enemies (actual enemies or those they might wrongly perceive to be their enemies).   The tone I see in this trailer (much like the tone in the last movie) sounds very much like, ""We poor Christians are being persecuted!"" Personally, I don't think that's the attitude Jesus was advocating. First Peter 4:15 also contains some advice from a first-or-second-century Christian to other Christians to be careful whether they are ""suffering as a Christian"" or suffering ""as a meddler in the affairs of others.""

2016-03-22T12:15:15,"It's sad to see why so many people have fallen into the egoistic modern mindset. Thinking that because they are strong in science and are the ""latest evolutionary species"" and the ""most intelligent"" and are not ""traditional and outdated"", they'd see religion as outdated. The idea of God is outdated? Science proves that God doesnt exist? big bang and evolution proves that God doesnt exist? Science is only the study of what is, and what could have been. Patterns, systems, the way things work. But it is not history. Yes the universe we currently have takes millions of years to come to where it is today. That's the process. But did it occur? Maybe not. People fail to see that whether or not the earth seems to be billions of years old, could have been already created that way. If God created the earth when its age according to science is 0 years old, and put humans on it right away, would the environment be appropriate for life to be sustained? That would make God a fool and would directly contradict the fact that He is able to create everything yet not look into this matter. Science can explain the current ongoing process (but still not be able to explain a million other mysteries about this world), but it does not prove the origin of everything. Big bang's origin is a bang. Where did the big bang come from? some even believe that the universe is expanding, and prior to the big bang, it was converging and expanding like a spring. So.. does that explain the origins of all things? no. Science merely explains what could have been and what currently is. To say that God does not exist because of such ""theories"" or ""facts"" does not disprove God.   If scientist were to go back to our day of creation by time travel, do a biological test on day 1 of Adam's existence, they'd go like ""oh it seems base on science, he is 30 years old approximately (just hypothetical age for illustration) and he is an adult. He must have lived 30 years already."" This is what scientists and atheists are doing. Yes on that day he may be 30 years old already based on science, but did he live the past 30 years? They can explain what could have been but they cannot say it indeed happened as a fact unless there were witnesses that such events did happen such as Adam being born from another human who was born from another and another originating from an ape right back to the first organism on this earth.  People are condemning those who believe in a God, while holding fast to science. Yet they cannot see that science cannot exist by itself. Laws do not create themselves. Governments can enact a set of law. A body establishes laws or regulation. Organisations come up with their rules and regulations that all must comply to. In the case of religion and God, scientist are claiming that humans are living and all nature is how it is today, the ecosystem working this way, the blood carrying food and oxygen to our cells, etc etc all because of science (the law). And according to this ""law"", it seems like the earth is billions of years old therefore there is no God. Who created the laws? who established them? did science create itself to establish that one S shell in an atom should contain how many electrons?What people are doing is just believing in the law and claiming that there is no one who established such laws. Many theories have been discovered. Anti-matter etc. Even if they could prove big bang was caused by such things, where did they come from? what scientific laws did this things comply to? did they exist by themselves?  Science and God goes hand in hand. To say science contradicts the idea of God or disproves God's existence is just throwing a point without considering the bigger picture. To say God is an imaginary friend and asking us to prove that He exist by showing us a very clear sign or show himself is just not any different than me thinking that another person's brains doesnt exist and requires him to show it to me. I wont believe it till I see it and feel it. Of course to meet such a demand is outrageous, unless that person has died or has his skull smashed and his brains ooze out and I so happen to witness it. But to say that person has no brains? imaginary brains, are they? Of course people would argue and say ""oh based on autopsy on other dead people it shows that humans have brains, based on  CT scan of this person he has his brains, etc etc. But that's not giving me direct proof of a specific person's brain. What if there were an alien inside instead of a brain? Of course I'd have to have faith and believe that based on biological facts established from other human bodies, and the way CT scans work, I come to believe this person has a brain.   What about God? To say ""oh he is just imaginary"" or ""I dont see him so I dont believe"" or ""So many people are suffering, proves that God doesn't exist"" is just naive. If you want to see the reason as to why people claim a God exist, delve deeper into religious teachings and writings and start seeing the bigger picture by seeing the strong points from science and religion or philosophy. See the world and think. People love the easy way out and be bias with their source of information without much consideration. Considering only so little facts or easily succumb to brainwashing information from others. It is easy to say God doesn't exist just by looking at the surface. I'd definitely not believe a person has brains if he kept saying stupid statements if I were to not learn science and not want to dig deeper into science.   I believe in a God. Science is still slowly uncovering many things about this world, but it can only go as far as the humans mind can perceive it.",0,1,Sfarter92,Sxz-Y-c2UUc,0.04176696365649854,2016-03-22 12:15:15,True,True

I respect his belief in not believing in anything, in fact i've never even wanted to talk to him about God and had no interest in doing it. Yet he knows i'm a christian. He's always making fun and throwing jokes at me calling numerous names for believing in God. So it's not us christians who are trying to ""shove down our religion down your throats"" all the time. In fact we get most of the dirt thrown at us for believing in God. If we want to believe in God, let us believe in God. If you guys want to believe you guys came from the evolution of monkeys then do so. If you even want to believe that we came from a damn fish. Then. Go. Right. Ahead.

I think as a human that if anyone believes in a god, then they have every natural right to answer any question of a student on that matter with a yes or no, but to quote from the Bible on the question it can cause some big baby parents to get upset. my personal response to the movie is that yes it goes over board with the idea that courts would deal with this kind of matter, but some atheists have an anger that builds up in their hearts because of a death of a loved one, or because of something they just don't like about ""religion."" to be fair I don't think all atheists are angry at the idea of a god, even so they just have a more generally accepted philosophy on life that is not bound by just belief or faith in the unseen. For all the "" it takes a community to raise a child"" socialist out there, what if someone answers your child's religious question and tells your child a basic quote, ""love your enemy as yourself"" how would that make you feel, I mean it's not like he/she is your enemy or anything, this is what it means to love your enemy even the one that you just don't like, it means to set aside your pride of life, looks and differences and be kind and gentle to them even if they hurt you. really all the bible talks about in the old testament is that if you move on to someone else's property and aren't able to pay then you have to serve them seven years until the debt is paid in off in labor. most people who talk about that bible and turn it into a bad book don't actually know what they are saying, for example the old testament talks about how at that time period kings would use their gods to divide the nations so that  they could conquer them, but God saw what they were doing to his people ( the Israelites) he had them  kill the opposing nations. I'm only stating facts from what I read in the bible, but if I were to agree that what people believe must stay in there minds and out of the schools then that would make me a comfort conformist and a socialist. this statement is a comment to some of the comments posed, and to react to my comment would only be to make yourself feel good about your pride, beliefs, thoughts on this comment or rejection of it so please think before you post.",0,15,Dame Hawk,Sxz-Y-c2UUc,0.1744408369408369,2016-03-28 19:05:04,False,True

Christians are never on the bandwagon train that all athiest are bad or as presented in these two movies. In fact there are isolated cases much like the ones in these films. But these are all true things that Christians experience. If anyone has a persecution complex its you guys who feel the need to make it a point that somehow this movie is about atheist as a whole. Self centered much? Anytime a movie comes out with a bad atheist you guys flock together with a ""mess with one of us mess with all of us"" attitude but are the first ones to bail on eachother when an athiest misrepresents you. Well tough there are good and bad athiest. You guys criticise Christians for the same things but there's no such things as bad Christians. There's Christians and fakes who call themselves Christians but aren't. Get that straight. Deal with the fact that we choose to speak out about very real things we experience more often than not with bad athiest. Not saying at all that all athiest are the same. I've met some extremely reasonable people but in my honest experience I've delt with more of the bad than the good. But this movie aint about all of you its about all of the bad ones that misrepresent you.   Plus we Christian folk are always misrepresented in movies and tv. You don't see us throwing fits with hateful comments like a lot of you have. And we've had to deal with being treated as crazy religious folk as a result of that. And we aren't that at all. Real Christian folk don't disown their kids for coming out as gay, real Christians don't go hating on others we don't go labeling others. All the hateful things done all of the discrimination that we see done by people who ""represent"" God don't. The very real loving and merciful God that true Christians represent is above all of that. We're all in this together so deal with it at least we are representing a very real example of people in our films. We say it as it is and everything said by one of the athiest just in this trailer is something I've either heard on a personal level or known through someones else that it happened to.

You don't have to believe to see this film, it's just an inspirational movie that many can relate to. Being silenced is a harsh feeling to come across. It's a reality that everyone faces in some point in time. It hurts. Don't sit there and criticize a film that gives hope to people; believers or not. There's a broader message being spread throughout these films (especially the first one). Don't shut people down just because you are annoyed by their belief. Sure, there's many that push their beliefs on people, but that's not the point. There's things that YOU believe that many may not necessarily agree with.

Some of those rules, are not followed by a lot of people today. Here are some of Jesus teachings my Atheist brothers.-""Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honor your father and mother, and love your neighbor as yourself.""-So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you."" -""For if you forgive men when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.  But if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins."" -What good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his soul?"" -You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'  But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven."" -""No one can serve two masters.  Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other.  You cannot serve both God and Money."" The church that was formed by man, was to preach those words of Jesus, and for people in the world to come together. But what happens when man gets power, some change, and thus change the true meaning of Jesus Christ and his teachings. Those wars in history, that were fought under Christianity, and killed thousands of people, had nothing to do with Jesus and his teachings. Those wars were caused by man, and his thirst for power, changing everything that Jesus stood for.Now if you think of Jesus as son of god like I do or you don't, one thing you and the whole world should know, is that this man, was a good man, that was born in this earth, tried to change the world for the better of human kind, instead of celebrating in him, some are still persecuting him.My Atheist brothers, you have to know one think, there is a positive energy and a negative energy, what do I mean by that, there is God and there is also the Devil, we choose who we allow in our hearts. We know what is good and what is bad, we all have sinned, that's why we must ask for forgiveness Amen.",0,0,God Allmighty,Sxz-Y-c2UUc,0.12325757575757576,2016-04-02 07:06:35,False,True

2016-04-04T04:32:27,"Boy, that like-dislike ratio says a whole lot about the quality of these movies.  I'm a Christian, and even though I'd probably side with the Defendant in this scenario, I highly doubt that those who try to silence Christianity are as two-dimensional as many of the Youtube comments on this video.  I want to recommend this movie, and its predecessor, but I simply can't do that for non-Christians.  Honestly, it looks like the best thing I'll be able to say about this movie is that, if we're not careful, this fictional, at least slightly exaggerated scenario could become a reality one day.  Heck, contrary to what many of the comments assert, Christians in the West are being singled out and attacked for publicly expressing their beliefs.  The ACLU, mentioned in this trailer, is notorious for fighting against Christians' right to religious freedom, going so far as to sue the USCCB in order to force it to cooperate in providing abortion-related treatment.  I don't know the exact details, but I do know that it's an attack on religious freedom if ever I saw one.  The USCCB has always asserted that abortion is morally wrong and cannot and ought not to be condoned.  So to force them to cooperate with providing abortion-related treatment is an attack on religious freedom.  You could argue that abortion is a woman's right and that denying it is unconstitutional, but that's not the point I'm trying to make here.  The point is that if the ACLU can sue a group of Christians to try and force them to participate in something they believe to be morally wrong and no one bats an eye, then there's something very wrong here.  If the trailer is anything to judge by, then the only thing you should take seriously about this movie is that this could be our future.

Gravity would have to be perfect, the sun, perfect , the Moon just far enough away not to cause harm, water perfect for drinking, Plants, food and so on would have to already been in place , oh and animals as well , gotta eat , right?

Well that's another story.  Now back to reality , I can walk where Jesus walked , I can go where he traveled , there is far more proof that there is a GOD then not. Just sit back and think about it, really think about it , think about every little thing that would need to happen for us to be here ,  now think about all the variables as well , it's mathematically impossible for us to evolve , the odds for everything to be perfect and stay perfect until adulthood, heck we have a hard enough time now in 21st century to stay alive let alone the beginning of time. So really the bottom line is , do I believe in a Evolution Monkey God or when I die then go into Darkness God, or something greater , something that puts some so much information into our DNA  If you unravelled all it from all of your cells and laid out the DNA end to end, the strand would stretch from the Earth to the Sun hundreds of times (the sun is approximately 98 million miles away from Earth).That's just your DNA.

2016-04-16T13:33:27,"See the movie. I Saw the movie. Listen...freedom of speech is on trial here. Its a freedom for everyone. There are precedents being set today in courts around the world. Regular people, but unwittingly misdirected by lack of knowledge are against Christians. And then there are others that act in an  evil way ...are people that are directed by dark forces that exist, are regular everyday people that are being used to manipulate by cunning ways - because they have not see a real Christian yet...live and give and love...and are sadly moved to hurt a free society. If you haven't had an experience with God yet fine. But don't knock the one that has. It seems phony to unbelievers...but its true, cause I once was one....until SOMETHING HAPPENED. The supernatural world is real...not aliens...and sci fi stuff...but the God is love stuff. When the world finally sees Christians standing up for love and what they believe in ...When the world sees this---when the unbelievers finally see this--- they will stop hating them and open their eyes to the truth and work along side of them, not hate them. Christians are a great benefit to all societies and Jesus even told hem to obey the governments over them as to show their obedience to God, above, who governs all things. To pay to Caesar what is his and pay to God what is God...its a win win. However, when a government no longer allows the freedom to believe for all men that choose to believe...then we should pray and see ways to change the laws that hinder that freedom.  The unbelievers that watched Mother Teresa of Calcutta closely---caused them to totally change their thinking and their lives and finally believed in love...perhaps not God all the way...at first, but at least in love and the possibility that God is alive cause they saw His presence in her face and in the face of those receiving that love. Its a far cry from other religions that say kill everyone that doesn't believe like you do...that is not a religion but an ugly ideology. For this life we came here to love not to kill. I pray that all the doubters reading this to ask God to show himself to them...to yes, pray to God and say...Please reveal yourself to me...I want to believe in something more than this awful life of unkindness, greed, and chaos.  Melissa Joan Hart did a good job in acting. Very believable. I came out of the theater singing the song. Dear ones,  If we don't stand up now what will become of the next generation. We must remember our Christian forefathers had to run away from their country for a better world...they created it with God's help. They came to this country for religious and political freedom. Where will our children and grandchildren run to next if we don't stand up for what we believe? The moon? It as to happen now and it has to happen where you live now. Trouble follows you everywhere...stop running people.  Start telling your story, start giving your testimony in the highways and byways. Teens share your faith at school. Pray at lunch two by twos. Pray every night, during the night and in the daytime...Pray for the conversion of souls. People need the Lord. JEsus is kind, forgiving, loving, patient and will accept you where you are!. Why are people afraid of that? One reason because, like he said to the woman caught in adultery when she was about to be stoned...all the people walked away when he said...let those without sin cast the first stone...they walked away...but what did He say to her...""Go and sin no more."" People don't want to stop their sinning. That's why people want to choose other religions...cause they feel they can sin and sin...that they shouldn't repent. God is holy. He wants us Holy. In this movie the teacher kept the rules of the school board...and just answered a question about a legally historical figure...just like anyone else in the history books. We have a right, so far, to speak of this wonderful person of Jesus. But in the spiritual rhelm we must go further than just a historical man, we must tell what we have seen and heard as Christians. That is our gospel to the world too. St. Paul said I am not ashamed of the gospel.  The great sin of the American churches is that they are silent at work, silent in the universities, silent in their neighborhoods and silent even at home. Jesus said proclaim the gospel through to the ends of the earth! He gave us a command to love one another, love our enemies, feed them if need be.Christians are called to stand for the good. They are trying to follow laws of love. Atheists must stand with Christians...Why is it ,  just because they don't believe in Jesus..why do they resist this idea? They should look at the common Christians life. Christians should be the first to comfort, reassure, embrace the homeless, the unlovely ,  helpless widow, abandoned orphans, children being used in sextrades and those on the fringe of society. When is that hard to believe or side with? Unless one believes in evil?  Perfect love casts out all fear. This is how the world will recognize us ....by how we love one another...one last question... What makes the best sense to the world is that it needs love...and that grace and power can only come from God himself...cause we can see what, man without God, is capable of so I ask, ""Who do you say Jesus is?""",0,1,mamamialove,Sxz-Y-c2UUc,0.1538733899845011,2016-04-16 13:33:27,False,True

But hey, as long as it goes along with what they believe who cares, right? Because apparently Christianity is the highest, truthful power in the world and decides everything. #3 Forcing beliefs down others' throats; holy shit it's like they don't know when to stop! These characters seem to think that they're handing students the keys to heaven by making them listen to this chick's religious beliefs, but if a teacher were to say that being gay isn't a choice or is ""okay"", suddenly they're the victims. They're always the victims apparently. ""How dare you repress and offend us!"" #4 No one's telling you not to be Christian; your religion is your business, just don't go around showing favoritism to one religion when you're in a position of authority or someone is just sick and tired of hearing about it! #5 You're faith really isn't under attack; the problem is you forcing and encouraging your beliefs when it's making your students very uncomfortable.

Jesus's name is powerful. It evolves different emotions from everyone which in one way is good because it preserves the sanctity of His name and also can be dangerous if misused. Christians should be sensitive to others and not get preachy. The teacher in that split second went from being a teacher to a preacher without being sensitive to the students around her. We don't live in a communist society but rather separation of church and state. We are a melting pot of ideas and views.

I am just as sinful and proud, God opened my eyes for His truth and Holiness.. but also for a way to be forgiven and cleansed from my sin.

Eventually, her parents find out, and decide to sue for mostly financial reasons. I doubt they even cared about the actual reason they were suing the teacher.

I'm not comfortable with students without parental consent having to sit through a class on creationism or evolution without parental consent.  Evolution is a belief with a lot of evidence scientifically backing it up. If people conjure long enough they would realize that in evolution it is very possible for there to be an advance society that we devolved from ""I.E. The lost city of Atlantis"". Which allegedly exist in the time of ancient Greece.  There are pyramids in mexico that where created by the Mayans. That used advanced math ""I.E. Analytical geometry"". These pyramids where built using advanced math that one could argue that was invented by them. There had to be driven force to give them the knowledge to create those. They would arque that it was the myan God's to me that would be defined as my saitain.  I would never openly bash an atheist but to something had to come from something. Nothing didn't come from nothing. People should be more compassionate towards each other because we need society to function as a collective consciousness not as divided because then our societies that we work so hard to maintain just collapse in on itself.  We need to work together to build a unified consciousness where there are no wars and we need to just get along. Getting rid of organized religion is not the answer we just need to come together and just plain love each other and put aside our petty differences and just come together, not be consumed by our differences any longer.

Not every ""christian"" will force things down your throat we'll talk about it in hopes that you believe too but at the end of the day if you say no we have to accept that. So just because someone claims they're Christian it doesn't make them Christian.

2016-08-02T19:51:01,"People are so blind nowadays. They say ""Science proves God doesn't exist."" They say ""Science has provided us a real religious system"" Where, in fact, they are wrong. The Bible was written *very* long ago, we all can agree? That's proven? Thumbs up all around? That would mean the Bible was written before many scientific advancements and discoveries. Now listen to me here, When we humans thought the earth was held by a giant animal (1500-ish B.C), the bible dictated that ""He hangs the earth upon nothing."" (Job 26:7) This would mean the Bible told us about the earth being just a rock in space when everyone though it was held by a large animal. The Bible also tells us the earth was round, when everyone thought the earth was flat. ""It is he who sits upon the circle of the earth"" (Isaiah 40:22). It is also fun to note that Columbus based his expedition on the scriptures.  To quote my source entirely: ""Solomon described a ""cycle"" of air currents two thousand years before scientists ""discovered"" them. ""The wind goes toward the south, and turns about unto the north; it whirls about continually, and the wind returns again according to his circuits"" (Ecclesiastes 1:6).""  "" The great biological truth concerning the importance of blood in our body’s mechanism has been fully comprehended only in recent years. Up until 120 years ago, sick people were ""bled,"" and many died because of the practice. If you lose your blood, you lose your life. Yet Leviticus 17:11, written 3,000 years ago, declared that blood is the source of life: ""For the life of the flesh is in the blood.""  ""Most cosmologists (scientists who study the structures and evolution of the universe) agree that the Genesis account of creation, in imagining an initial void, may be uncannily close to the truth"" (Time, Dec. 1976).  Sources:  https://www.livingwaters.com/witnessingtool/scientificfactsintheBible.shtml  http://www.eternal-productions.org/101science.html  So tell me, non-believers, why are these phrases and passages in the Bible thousands of years before Scientific advancement.",0,4,Divide,Sxz-Y-c2UUc,0.023095238095238096,2016-08-02 19:51:01,False,False

No, I am not asking you to hate or troll Muslims. I am a Christian and my god tells me to love everyone. It would be wrong of me to ask you hurt others.

If you are an atheist oder a muslem or a jew or a hindu or a buddhist or what ever, you don't have to take it. I don't take it anymore, eventhough I'm catholic, because I think it's boring. But a friednd of mine is an atheist and goes to this Religion class because she wants to learn about the Religion. On my school you also have to take a class called ethnics from grade 7 to grade 10. In this subject you learn about morals, social standards, different cultures and societies and religions. We learnd there about the beliefs of the Islam, Christianity, Jewry, Hinduism and Buddhism. I think, it is important to learn about all these Religions, cultures etc., so you can understand the people and countries better and to be more openminded.

I dont get how people can live without God in their life. but maybe i shouldnt question it, cause it was indeed written that not all people are able to recieve the grace of God. but if you do believe, then you are the chosen one. and non-christians would prolly be attacking that but yeah why waste time to convince those people when we can spend time spreading the words of God to people who are lost. i think being a genuine christian in america is really hard. Recently, gay marriage just got legalized and i just hope they wont get married in churches that aren't supporting LGBT (i know most gays arent religious but some are). they should respect what's written in the bible. there are also some churches that supports gay marriage and it's their business with God. well i dont know exactly the struggles of being a christian in america,  cause obviously im not american. but im gonna watch it soon. looks interesting.

The results are wars and discrimination. But religion also has positive impact. And only the blind wont be able to see that.

2016-09-16T17:58:20,"Many evolutionists claim that natural selection is the process that drives fish-to-philosopher evolution. Amoeba-to-architect evolution requires that, over time, living things must add more information to their DNA as they gain new features, abilities, or structures. However, natural selection actually works in the opposite direction of what molecules-to-man evolution requires. It selects from already-existing genetic information, and cannot generate new genetic information.  God created the original animal kinds with much diversity in their DNA, so that as they reproduced and filled the earth, their descendants were able to adapt to many different environments. Scientists have observed this—animals reproduce “after their kind” (dogs have puppies, cats have kittens, geese have goslings, kangaroos have joeys, etc.). The genetic makeup of some members of a kind is more suitable to certain environments. Natural selection is the process by which animals die out when they don’t have the genetic makeup that allows them to survive in their environment.  Those animals that survive reproduce more animals like themselves. For example, many animals that live in drier regions of the world are able to gain most of the water they need from the plants they eat. Animals without this ability would have a harder time trying to survive in that region, and would eventually die out. Natural selection is not a process that changes molecules into men over millions of years. Natural selection may bring about a new species of animal, but it cannot generate a new kind of animal.",0,1,Godzilla John,Sxz-Y-c2UUc,0.29422915793883536,2016-09-16 17:58:20,False,False

The rise of technology is not due to a belief in evolution, either. Computers, cellular phones, and DVD players all operate based on the laws of physics, which God created. It is because God created a logical, orderly universe and gave us the ability to reason and to be creative that technology is possible. How can a belief in evolution (that complex biological machines do not require an intelligent designer) aid in the development of complex machines, which are clearly intelligently designed? Technology has shown us that sophisticated machines require intelligent designers—not random chance. Science and technology are perfectly consistent with the Bible, but not with evolution. Many people do not realize that science was actually developed in Christian Europe by men who assumed that God created an orderly universe. If the universe is a product of random chance , there is really no reason to expect order in nature. Many of the founders of the principle scientific fields, such as Bacon, Galileo, Kepler, and Newton, were believers in a created earth. The idea that science cannot accept a creationist perspective is a denial of scientific history.",1,1,Micah Henley,Sxz-Y-c2UUc,0.21812499999999996,2016-11-15 18:43:07,False,False
2016-11-16T11:22:32,"_I saw a comment where they say that atheist are bashing this movie and that proves Christians are doing something right. I'm Christian myself, and I was raised into the doctrine of attempting and having to believe in that religion. And if I didn't, I'll be prosecuted and lectured saying ""I'll go to hell!"" because I don't feel God. I mean, people hsce tried to justify to Mr clearly that God's there, but I never feel him. I have contacted constantly in the past, but I rarely do it now cause I don't see the point or feel anything while doing it. I had that faith that's needed to believe on what I'm doing and praying for, but I honestly got nowhere with it. I mean, I could've kept doing it and see a change, but I had a feeling that I was just wasting my time by doing such things like that. And they say ""God died on the cross for all of your sins"" But, if he died on the cross for our sins, why does sin still exist? Yeah, it still exist because they say the devil as in Satan attempts to make people feel the need to do certain things. And yeah, God gave us the freewill, but our freewill to experience things that we feel that is ""us"" as a person. But either way, experiening that is wrong if  you're not living up in ""His"" sight. Then what's the point of freewill of its going to be wrong whether if we find it right or if it's right in general. But our standard of right doesn't matter though, only his does. And if we have thoughts other than what he provides specifically, then it's wrong. But wouldn't sin even exist if hr dud for all if sins to vanish forever, but yet, he created us with din again and will contradict what he says and will say we'll go to hell for things he should've already known from the beginning of he's perfect as he sets himself out to be. And people always try to rationalize things as they want too because the believe in God, and since I believe in God, I can justify my thoughts freely without judgement. Well, that's not fair then, knowing that you're basing your own knowledge on what you think instead of get the Bible says to follow. Wouldn't you consider that a bit... hypocritical in a way. And God is suppose to be SO loving that everyone says, but he has destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah instead of logically trying to see what he can do. But no he just decides to kill them off and not have them a chance. that's great because in today's society, people don't ever give you a chance to explain your thoughts verbally anymore. it's all about them, but never about ""how you feel""._  *I tried giving my reasons with this and what i think about certain things.

The Wall Street Journal reports that the pests “are quickly evolving to withstand the pesticides used to combat them.”  As creationists often try to explain, such resistance is not evolution in the molecules-to-man sense. The survival of the bedbugs that are resistant to pesticides shows only natural selection, or “selective survival” of certain variations of bedbugs.  Some of the creatures already possessed resistance to the pesticide via variations in their DNA, which they had as a result of mutations or God’s original created diversity. The survivors then passed along their resistance to their descendants, while those that did not possess the resistance died.  Contrary to the impression left by the media, no new genetic information was added to change bedbugs into a new type of organism. They are still bedbugs. Their resistance to pesticides points to the incredible designs that God gave His creatures so that some could survive and thrive, even in a fallen world.",0,1,Micah Henley,Sxz-Y-c2UUc,0.1947974644403216,2016-12-21 02:21:01,False,False

How much the world tries to silence us we will never be silenced or stoped as we keep spreading love and real peace that comes with the gospel of love to all far corners of the earth and we are by far the leading religion of the world with the Bible being the  worlds highest sold book in history with over 3.9 billion copies sold with how many ever were given for free... the actual amount is un calculated... the oppression only drives us to spread the love and the only truth more and more... it's amazing 😍❤️🙌🏽 God is NOT DEAD!,0,1,shalomi panchi,Sxz-Y-c2UUc,0.32279829545454547,2017-02-16 18:23:18,False,False

All of Jesus' disciples were brutally killed because they were preaching the gospel. The bible is a true historic book with REAL people and REAL events. If you claim none of it happened then you better jump on some good research proving it is false you won't even find that.  there are nonchrisitian sources written by people that wrote about Jesus. He was a real man our Lord who died for our sins. I too was once atheist but God changed my heart. God is REAL I have seen miracles before my very eyes that science can't explain. if man were truly evolving you would think our moral standards would be at their highest, people would be at peace no violence or killing or hate but its been at its highest now, and the reason for that is that the world is enslaved by hate and sin. Jesus is the only one who can set us free and if you don't believe their is a solution you will go your whole life neglecting life is absurd with out God. What purpose do we have?

2017-05-26T21:28:58,"Dear Friends, I've just finished watching this film on Netflix. It's very American! The film is about a history teacher who is taken to court for talking about Jesus in her classroom.  Part of me was squirming inside as I watched. Typical Christian type of film? Yes, I was indeed embarrassed and uncomfortable as I watched it, but I was determined to see it through.  Why was I squirming? Why was I comfortable? Maybe I've become to cool to talk about Jesus in an open and direct manner?  Maybe I've become sophisticated instead of childlike.  Maybe I dont like looking stupid in front of people?  The truth is this woman risked her job rather than deny her LORD who had always loved her and cared for her.  I sense that in the West, we must either die to our sophistication or else accept being silenced by the atmosphere of the society and media around us.  It's time for us to become childlike once again. Little children have no grasp of sophistication, they simply say what they are thinking........  Watch the film on NETFLIX.

I must say, it's a huge disappointment. There was absolutely no subtlety or nuance and the entire film was one giant illustration of the Christian persecution complex. All the atheists/non-Christians (apart from the defence lawyer and he seemed to be moving towards Christianity) were shown as mean-spirited, shallow and self-obsessed to the point of caricature. We were asked to believe that two parents who had lost a son didn't even give a damn because they were atheist, we had all of the school staff and legal team being shown as not only not religious but militantly atheist. In contrast, every one of the Christians was shown to be impossibly polite and innocent at all times. No attempt was made to capture the reality that the world is really made up of shades of grey. Pretty much every character in the film was either a die-hard atheist who didn't just happen to believe in God but actively hated Christianity or a fully committed born again Christian. How is that even slightly reflective of reality?   In addition, the premise of the film (that a teacher would be dragged through the courts for a minor infraction like that) is laughable. However, actually it IS technically true that she broke the rules. She quoted from scripture with no qualification such as ""Christians believe that..."" and then offered up a Christian view of Christ's good character. That is preaching not teaching and it does conflict with the separation of church and state. I don't think though that anyone would have seriously made a huge fuss about it and the very least she'd have got would've been a slap on the wrist by the headteacher.  The thing which was genuinely not ok though was how she talked privately outside school and didn't attempt to refer the child for counselling or anything like that but, again, preached her religion. I don't know how things usually are in the US but it would be considered highly unprofessional in the UK for a teacher to be meeting with a child outside of school full stop, let alone trying to convert them!",23,0,Michael Hester,Sxz-Y-c2UUc,-0.010622923588039866,2017-07-31 20:51:55,False,False

That should be all human faith.. The belive in unreal and unknowned things is a risky and maybe a dangerous belive. The idea of all my comment is very simple.. we just have to be more realistic and less drive it by our emotions.. I seen study s about beliver s.. many beliver s start the belive in ,,God s,, because their minds at some moment give up in face of a very strong emotional event and that create a strong feel/emotion inside which support very well the idea of a kinda ,,God,, or something like that .. Per short you can say this belive in ,,God,, is like a pshycologhic thing what happend just in human brain and as we know the brain give the order into our body.. if you can trick the brain with an idea based on emotional event,the rest of the body is allready tricked too.

These coworkers did not ask for it and he was not handing them out as a private citizen but a public official. This is proselytizing on the job and this is not allowed. Now not all Christians have an insane persecution complex like the ones this movie is made for. Now you could argue; ""But if you hate this movie then why would you watch it?"" Well these movies are clear propaganda. The first movie was basically saying that if you don't believe in god then your girlfriend will leave you and you will get hit by a car and die. This movie is portraying atheist as evil screaming lunatics.

Things like having the right to keep chickens in your garden, even in cities. Or planting veggies in your garden, etc. And now - Jesus is banned in the U.S.??? Since when?

It's a Christian based movie, what were they expecting it to be about? Just a bunch of Christian bashing going on while trying to appear intelligent and self righteous.     I'm also amazed at how much atheist seem to know so much about a God they don't even believe in, at least they think they do.     He is real. He knows all about you. He loves you. He died for you.
