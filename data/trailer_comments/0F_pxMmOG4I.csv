2014-03-14T00:12:33,"Hmm... looks rather promising. Yeah it could end up having some typical biopic film traits but Chadwick Boseman seems to be doing a good job at mimicking Brown's movements and his voice. This seems like a massive step up from 42 where he was just... okay.   Though I am still wondering what the actual plot is. Outside of course the rise of James Brown and the impact he had on pop-culture and music. Just based off the trailer, it seems to have a lot of the troupes that are in every biopic. Troubled childhood and young adult years, rise to fame, doing something that isn't ""the norm"", but in the end it gains him great success and so on.   I don't think this is going to be the next ""Ray"", but this could also be just a nice little film to show a little more of who he was and maybe help expose more people to his music.   I'll give it a shot. ",1,0,docdave15,0F_pxMmOG4I,0.18101851851851852,2014-03-14 00:12:33,True,True

I'm sure the director probably tried to get a well known black actor to play James but the well known black actors probably weren't available. I saw Chadwick in 42 movie about Jackie Robinson and i think he did a good job. 42 is a good movie. Chadwick was also in Draft Day movie i saw yesterday.

I don't get the feeling that the creators cared much about a great story line, but more so being the first to throw out a biopic about Mr Brown.  They were probably hoping to get similar results as ray.  not going to happen & if it does it will be undeserving. Fans of Mr Brown will like it because of the music & the guy who does the role justice but I can't see any other reason than that and I can't see it doing as well as Ray.  word of mouth sometimes  is everything.",0,0,dee rasta,0F_pxMmOG4I,0.2072463768115942,2014-08-03 20:25:29,False,True

When you see Brown, Jackson and Lee (Bruce) you get a long continuous shot (which Bruce Lee insisted upon) to let you know there is no splicing; it's all them. When you see those fast edits you know someone messed up. So now they have to show part of the move, fix it and quick cut from where they messed up.

Seeing the film made me want to go and research not James Brown, but Bobby Byrd and how they really met. It was interesting reading just to find out how much of an influence Bobby Byrd actually had in the recordings of James Brown. Read about Bobby Byrd on Waikaepaedia and get the real truth. James Brown had the stage presence, that it persona but if not for Bobby Bryd not only discovering James, but being the influence behind most of his hits (without the recognition), we may never have heard of James Brown; one interesting note I found out was that the Gospel Starlighters actually changed their name to The Flames prior to James joining the group and it also tells how they actually met. I realize movies take liberties to change facts around, but it makes me want to see just how close the movie was to the truth, never the less, a really enjoyable movie. If Jamie can get an Oscar for his portrayal of Ray, why not Chad; a performance filled with a lot of energy in my opinion.
