Even to be so low as to create a sort of franchise chain off a particular story simply because ""hey that movies popular, let's capitalize on that"".  The art, the comedy is destroyed. Capitalist executive profiteers make lousy film makers, comedians and artists.  Even the comedians of today don't have the same approach of the greatest comedians,  the cast from the 70s and 80s, such as Chase, but also Murray, Short, Candy, the list of goes on and on. Sadly, todays generation in their 20s and younger have no clue who these greats are. They had more of a complex self deprecating type of humor while today the pitch is shock value like showing a penis or just letting people get violently hurt.

It's supposed to be like this so people like your parents can watch it and get a refreshing revamp of one of the best comedies from the 80's (when comedy was original and actually good IMO). I highly recommend everyone that hasn't seen it to check out the original. Its an absolute classic and one of the best comedies I've ever seen.

2015-07-29T13:40:49,"1ST ONE WAS RELEASED JULY 29TH 1983 THATS COOL. FUN FACT = Just like John Belushi, who starred in Animal House, Chevy Chase had previously performed in the National Lampoon Radio Hour and in the stage show National Lampoon Lemmings, both of which were spin-offs from National Lampoon magazine. In each of the main films of the series, the Griswold children are portrayed by different actors. This is usually attributed to the fact that after Anthony Michael Hall declined to reprise his role in European Vacation in order to star in Weird Science, it was decided to recast both children. Chase has indicated that it was his idea to continue recasting the children by explaining, ""I always wanted to make the joke, 'Geez, I hardly ever get the chance to see the kids anymore. I hardly know who they are. We should go on a vacation.' That was funny to me: the idea that Clark was such a great family man, but still didn't even recognize his own children.""",0,0,Liv4 Sun,ScMOyURq9os,0.06904761904761904,2015-07-29 13:40:49,False,True

First off this isn't a reboot, its just another installment, it's pretty much a sequel, it is Chevy Chases son grown up, having a vacation with his family. Secondly, the humour that made the first films food, is now overdone and they quite simply don't sell very well in the modern world. Sadly, what people seem to like these days is the potty humour, Ted, A Million Ways To Die In The West, Superbad, This Is The End ect. which I don't mind. With that being said, a lot of the humour in this movie is all referential, they are almost self aware of the other movies and decides to poke fun at that. As shown in the Ferrari clip at the end of the trailer.If you ignore that this is another installment, if you just stop comparing it to the first few movies and look at it as another modern day comedy movie, you will enjoy it a lot more.

It was even shittier than I expected. apparently the movie had a budget of 30 mil and grossed over 100 mil. Very shocking. if there was such a thing as getting a refund for a movie after you saw it and then it would be erased from your memory.... this movie would have made zero! European Vacation was 10 times as entertaining as this, and we all know how bad that movie was. So predictable ( not just because of the trailers) because of bad writing. It was like watching a train wreck. As I watched it, I came up with so many ways that the movie could have been better or edited differently to make the movie watchable. I ended up being fixated on how they went wrong every couple minutes and how easily they could have made it better. They just went for the cheap predictable dick joke, or a little kid saying ""fuck"", or you name it. Comparing the original to this POS is like comparing a Frank Sinatra song to a Miley Cyris song. One is classic, the other should not exist. Who the fuck signed off on this movie and why did Chevy or Beverly ever want to be in this movie or associated with it?? My only assumption is that they either must be running out of money, had a deal they couldn't say no to, or they didn't get to see the whole script??

As laymen, I know you feel puzzled as to how a movie can be worse than what you could write if you drank too much, ate a bunch of alphabet soup and vomited on a bunch of blank script pages. It's not much of a mystery if you consider two factors. First, the Hollywood elite, including Chevy Chase and the rest of the cast and crew that have a stake in the originals, are morally corrupt. To them, kids swearing and raunchy comedy IS FUNNY. Second, the filmmakers KNEW THE FILM WAS HORRIBLE. THEY DIDN'T CARE. Bad, cheesy movies sadly have a target market, and are much cheaper to make. The filmmakers wanted a quick buck and knew they could spit out a film of bad quality that would find success because it was riding on the fame of the originals. They just wanted money. The sad part is this, the filmmakers spit on you as an audience. They knew you would expect it to be a quality film, knew they would get your bucks, and didn't care as they cut corners and pumped out easy to film crap so as to maximize their profits.

Clark and Ellen had the real chemistry that you just don't see with Rusty and Debbie. Unlike the '83 version, this wasn't portrayed as being a real, relatable story.
