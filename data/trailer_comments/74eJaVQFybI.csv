2016-12-15T03:57:44,"I remember when this movie came out, but I didn't wanna go see some boring movie about running. The only reason I watched it, is because I passed through McFarland a few weeks ago, and I remembered this Mexican girl from my class who is from there. I am glad I watched this movie and cudos to whoever made it. it was really inspiring and touching and was about much more than running. Some White people don't like this movie, because it showed the truth. I'm White and I can tell you that the comments and portrayal of both races in this movie are 100% true. Mexicans are more family oriented than White people, and it is true that Mexicans are more likely to have your back and be there when you need them. And Mexicans are also more likely to make friends with you ""true friends"", than White people. White people are only friends with you when they need something. The Quincienira scene touched me the most. I was saying throughout the movie, ""It's a Mexican town, they should throw her a Quinciniera."" There are White people who will say, ""Mexicans will never accept you in their communities."" That is SO not true! The anti-Mexican comments made by the White people and the behavior of the White athletes is a pretty accurate portrayal of a lot of White people's attitudes towards Mexicans. I'm proud to be White, but at the same time, I am ashamed and disgusted by the attitude of SO many White people. And for people saying ""Blanco"" was racist. Blanco means White in Spanish, and in Mexican culture it is customary for Mexicans to give their friends of any race nicknames, even rude ones. I know Mexicans nicknamed ""Stinky"" and ""Kakaios"" and Mexicans call my Polish dad ""Ruso"". The majority of Mexicans, especially the women¬†are super friendly and helpful, and do not have a problem with White people at all. Some people say Chicanos are different from Mexicans in Mexico, but Mexico City was still the only airport I've visited where most of the staff was actually friendly and helpful. Anyways, beautiful movie. I would rank this one right up there with ""A Perfect World"". I know critics say Kevin Costner's movies are the worst in Hollywood, but I actually really like his movies. Maybe if they cast someone else it wouldn't be so great, but Kevin Costner made it work. Anyways, I think Trump and his supporters should watch this movie.",49,1,briantravelman,74eJaVQFybI,0.12632101086048453,2016-12-15 03:57:44,False,False
