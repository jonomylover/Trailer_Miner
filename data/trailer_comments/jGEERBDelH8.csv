I think thats just the case of whining and not able to share what you were used to get in over abundance. Representation. Come back to me with your argument of too much feminist power when we get every month a movie with only women in it as characters while the men stay either absent, silent or flat plot devices or sexual objects. (my point here is, 300 is in no way a feministic movie. also for clearance what I gather from some comments: 300 as a whole is really fictional. Its a fantasy movie who is at best very very loosely based on a few historical facts who on top are very biased. For example, The persian empire as the bad guys? Ugh yeah no, not really. they were agressors, but they also outlawed slavery (took the greeks and their brethren of western civilisation only another roughly 2000 years) when they conquered they left their enemies political structure (Kings and governments )largely intact and only wanted them to pay taxes thats why the Persian king was called king of kings. They improved infrastructure and life in general for their people. Seriously if you want to pick a place to live in that time of history? The persian empire is probably the best place to live. But as I see 300 largely as fantasy movie I will still enjoy it.

Greece was such an amazing culture way ahead of the rest of the world. My professors called it the light of the world. And the world was jealous of greece and greedy. Its true the greeks fought each other over some aspects, but brothers always fight, and no matter how much they argue and fight, in the end, no one messes with your brothers except you. Its just too bad they didnt realize it until the end. Greece could have been something great in todays world. and maybe this world wouldnt be so fucked up if it took a lesson or two from their book..BADASS movie those, gets me pumped. Aesthetic nation!

2014-02-17T09:55:57," Here's Your History Lesson. Persians came twice to Conquer Greece and Failed once at Marathon under Darius I and the second time under Xerxes in what is called the Greatest Defeat of all time 10 yrs later    (1st time your history teach got it wrong) (Herodotus wasn't wrong either he used Persian records and spoke to survivors from both sides) This was the First World War ever. Persia had conquered the known world, civilizations that were far in advanced of persia, Babylon(ex). They then attempted to conquer what is now called Greece(Hellas) with treaties with Carthage to make sure the Greeks from Sicily and Calabria(Magna Graecia) would not come to it's aid. In plain words the whole Mediterranean Region was involved. It took them 10 yrs to set it up, built roads, supply lines. 1 million or more army, two pontoon Bridges across the Bosporus Strait, 1500 ships that could carry 250 or more men, 200 supply ships,  the persian LOST, at Salamis, and I yr later a Mycale(Sea) and Plataea(land). They never returned again they were defeated by 30,000 United Greeks. That's Greek history. By the way Persia started in 550 BC, Greece was around and colonizing the Aegean & Ionian coastline for 600 yrs prior the first persian even seeing the Mediterranean. They did it by sailing ,by trade, advancing their culture to a cultureless areas not conquering. Now as to your question would have Greece or the World been better off if the Persians had Won.  Of course not. There never would have been a democracy. Has one come about anywhere in the World without it’s basic knowledge of Greece. Has one come to the Middle East even with it's knowledge. Has a Ruler ever been good in those locations or for the most part anywhere else. NO! Have empires been cruel, certainly everyone has.. Even the Romans came to Athens to learn of it. It was the base of its Republic Democracy. How did the Republic of Rome fair after the Caesars took over? If it hadn't been for Cincinnatus do you think George Washington would have stepped down? (Cincinnatus was George's historical mentor) Napoliean when asked why he tried his comeback, his response was ""Who do you think I am George Washington"". Without Greece that would have never Happened.  As to slaves and the conquest of 'Might makes right',  That’s exactly how the Persians Ruled and Conquered. By the way Darius 1 slaughtered castrated 1000's boys and girls of the Revolting Ionian City States and he enslaved the woman using the boys a eunuchs and the woman/ girls as concubines. Xerxes did the same to Babylon and Egypt. You see my facts are better then your flawed theory. As to a weaken Greece because of it's civil war and Philip and then Alexander conquering what remained. Well at least he was Greek and then he Destroyed Persia. It's Called Revenge. Greeks don't take to others directing them or taking away their Freedom. And you should be damned happy that's the case otherwise we could be just like Iran Today. That was fun.",0,0,Boukephalos1,jGEERBDelH8,0.10803049289891398,2014-02-17 09:55:57,True,True

This was the beginning of the Ionian Revolt, which would last until 493 BC, progressively drawing more regions of Asia Minor into the conflict. Aristagoras secured military support from Athens and Eretria, and in 498 BC these forces helped to capture and burn the Persian regional capital of Sardis. The Persian king Darius the Great vowed to have revenge on Athens and Eretria for this act. The revolt continued, with the two sides effectively stalemated throughout 497–495 BC. In 494 BC, the Persians regrouped, and attacked the epicentre of the revolt in Miletus. At the Battle of Lade, the Ionians suffered a decisive defeat, and the rebellion collapsed, with the final members being stamped out the following year. would you not attack if you were the strongest empire in your time? tell me i would like to know. you know    i love history and Persia did not have such bad history in fact people who made this movie were bias if they werent they would of bring reasons for persia to attack greece not bringing crap with that stupid bold guy make him Xerxes i mean really thats just the worst movie i ever watched and it disrespected my culture and i will never forgive that",1,0,Prince of Persia,jGEERBDelH8,0.016605090311986873,2014-02-18 05:55:08,True,True

The only free countries are the ones located in North & south America and CHINESE EMPIRE is about to strike them hard. The only relative obstacle is the US and its states.  The US states are more independent and sometimes are in direct fight against its other, because they have different political & social ethics. 2 states are the dominant ones: NY in the East (ATHENS) & LA in the West (SPARTA). NY is more liberal, democratic & artistic society and LA is more conservative & militarized. NY has the best navy forces & LA has the best army.  The Chinese Empire invades, everyone is afraid and about to give up and then LA (SPARTA) sends few men for a last stand, to awaken the rest of the states with their sacrifice. If they don’t resist, every country in North & South America will collapse and surrender in just a few weeks. The last stand take place in Florida (Thermopylae) and then the Chinese forces march to conquer NY. A united force of NY (Athenians) and LA (Spartans) {NY leads the force} decide to face them in a sea battle. They win but the main Chinese force is still intact and camped somewhere in Mississippi.  The next months, united armies under LA (SPARTA) leadership face them in a battle (Plataea) and although outnumbered 12:1 they defeat them and throw them out of US, destroying practically their dreams for WORLD DOMINATION.  The next 50 years there is a constant war between NY & LA for territorial purposes ( NY has more blame for this war) and finally LA wins. But in fact there is no winner and the Chinese Empire is happy to see both states suffer, thinking that will have a better chance to invade in the future. But from this war, another dominant state is emerging that rules for the next 20 years and this is CHICAGO (THEVA).  CHINESE EMPIRE interferes constantly with US and trying to harm them, but then the dominant state of US becomes for the first time KENTACKY (MACEDONIA), which is consider from the other states , the redneck state and for the last 400 years hasn’t got any great achievements to show.  But KENTACKY (MACEDONIA) succeeds ( FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY OF US) to unite all of the states and they strike Chinese Empire in order to free the rest of the world.
