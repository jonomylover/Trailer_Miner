Chris Evans..well let's just say after watching that movie back he probably decides to take acting classes (yes he's a great cap merica) the actor (forgive me I forget names) who played reed Jesus he was dull and and the emotional range of a cabbage    The plots:  Both stories were horrendously rushed and full of holes and bad puns and inaccurate references to the comics   The production: well let's just say 1969 called to gloat about how their cardboard cutout monsters looked more realistic....

It was the corruption of Von Doom after the accident and his ""friends"", who were responsible for his corruption, standing up to him and fighting him down. They showed up how they controlled their abilities and how intelligent they were in doing so. They didn't have military backing. Heck, they had to fund the space exploration themselves.

You need to make them sign a contract to reprise future roles for at least a decade if not two.  For example the batman franchise just ended the trilogy in 2012 was it? and we already heard last year and this year about affleck and 2016 batman v superman.. wtf dude why not bring back the guy from the recent trilogy.  Then you got the human torch dude from fantastic four, now he became captain america.. what???? You got the hulk who had 2 origin re-tellings...  Idk its getting a bit out of hand, sign up younger people and keep bringing them back for future installments.

2015-06-25T21:53:19,"The preview alone goes so far away from the source material. I don't even know where to begin. They make them younger and instead of going into space, some alternate dimensional hop. Perhaps a younger audience can't relate to older people and a missing space program. Racebending is always a touchy subject. In the case of Nick Fury was a change for the better and he's awesome and it's been source material for years. Jordan is probably a good actor, but a change for the movie alone is just stupid and part of an annoying trend. At least they changed Franklin Storm so Johnny can't just be called a token, but it makes you wonder why they didn't touch Susan. Having Jordan play Thing would of just made more sense because it's easier to change characters who are not strictly connected with others. And as for thing, if Michael Chiklis hadn't already pulled off the look perfectly, this new one might be passible. It just looks overdone. Like some CG bakery nightmare. But if the actors can pull it off more power to them.  There's always those who enjoy creative liberty, but if they don't outnumber actual fans of the comics who immediately hate the changes, the movie will bomb big time. But then we'll get another reboot in 5-10 years anyway. The big hurdle will be getting past the origin story and doing well enough to make a sequel.

Not the shitty Fantastic 4 before. This story line is the best, in my eyes, especially when you get to know more about Ben and Reed's friendship when they were kids. Or how Ben went off to war at one point and didn't see Reed for years. Or how Ben fought off bullies for Reed for years. Reed looks like 17 year old because in the original, he was a young, naive science nerd from a college and Dr. Storm basically called him in and said ""Help me out."" whilst Doctor Von Doom was a college student as well and wanted to steal Reed's work because Reed was a new student and was already showing Doom up. (Reed and Dr. Hank McCoy aka The Beast are 2 of the smartest people in the Marvel world.) I'm just dying to see this.",0,0,Jasper Arbogast,wuV4BCYv-YY,0.283596837944664,2015-07-08 17:55:07,True,True

2015-07-15T19:00:44,"A plead from OUR FOREFATHERS. Hello my fellow Americans, in this very crucial attempt to save our Country from Hillary Clinton continuing in her and her Husband’s personal agendas to destroy it, I do plead with you... I plead with you in such a way that my heart is broken to the evilness those two people have brought to so many innocent Americans. We fought for the many things you, your kids,  your grandkids, and so on get to enjoy in a Country where you get to become whatever you want and do pretty much whatever you wish. with every fiber that once was us and from our peaceful resting places, we, your FOREFATHERS beg of you, plead with you, ask in the most sincere way and with all that we did to secure the very many special things that make The United States Of America what it is,,, we ask of you to please reconsider voting for HILLARY CLINTON for President of the very Country we died to protect and secure. You see she is the ENEMY; she is the same evilness we fought against in our personal efforts to secure what you have today. if we could come back and be who we once were we ALL would demand she and her husband be imprisoned for lies to the American people, theft from White House property, stealing money from tax payers, many many more things as well. But the one thing we would demand in a much stronger way they be impeached and sent to prison for would be for MURDER. You see whether you believe it or not, Hillary and Bill Clinton have had many many people killed for things they wanted to tell the truth about or simply for not doing what those two idiots wanted them to do. So, we beg and plead with you, the AMERICAN PEOPLE to do your homework in regards to whom and what those two idiots are truly about. Read the post below this one and most importantly, watch the videos and pass this and the video links to all you know. As I mentioned earlier, we the People need to stand and have our voices heard. We Don't want a MURDERER in Our White House..     People of this Country, do you not see her for who she really is, do you not see the EVIL in her eyes, do you not know that people died because of her poor choices to LIE about her emails, do you not know what OUR FOREFATHERS did for us and that she is destroying those things??  Please I beg you of to read this post and watch the videos at the end of it. Please take the time to find out the truth about whom and what Hillary Clinton truly is. She and her Husband have had people killed because those people wanted to tell the truth about so many things the Clintons were doing.  Alright so here's the deal in regards to all the Clintons, Hillary Clinton has said in the past that if she is ever voted in as President one of the first things she will do is take control of all manufacturing of ammunition in the United states Of America. She has said that yes we do have a right because of the 2 amendment to own guns,,,, but she went further to say that nowhere does it state we have a right to own and have in our possession ammunition. I'm telling you this Fellow Americans, if you were thinking to vote for her you really need to see these videos at the end of this posting. Remember what Our Forefathers did for us to secure our right to protect what is ours. Hillary Clinton disparately wants to take those rights away from us, Including the Daughter Chelsea. Now we have all heard of so many lies and downright evilness brought on by the Clintons. Brought on to so many Americans, Americans have died and their blood on the Clintons hands. I have put a few links just below for you to click on and see for yourself just a small degree of the power and evilness those two people have had on so many. I have many more as well so if you want to see more truth about them, just let me know. Remember if you will, Chelsea grew up at the hands of these to evil people so if you don't think she has every intention in carrying out what she has been taught,, your being fooled. If Our Forefathers could speak to us from their very peaceful resting places they would beg and plead for us to not vote in the ENEMY. Hillary Clinton and her path would most definitely prove she is the ENEMY. She is the ENEMY to our rights to own guns and ammunition, she is the ENEMY for us being able to live in a free country, and most importantly she in the ENEMY to our Beloved Constitution.. Please click on the links below and get ready to have your mind blown to the proof of what our COUNTRY has become and the death innocent death at the hands of those two idiots. Please remember the things Our Forefathers did for us and the promises they left. I promise you this fellow Americans, if Hillary Clinton becomes the next President; the Guarantee is there that this Country will continue to fall apart at the hands of the Clintons. Our Forefathers would also beg of you to do your homework and find out that all you will see in these videos are true and factual. And look into the EMAIL scandal as well. American's died because she thought it would be a great idea not to be HONEST..  If there one thing that is so evident about Hillary Clinton,,,,,,,,,   it's that she is a LIAR . She has been caught lying so many times that it's almost something we expect from her. And still,, she gets to run for President?????????? So I speak to the woman of this great Country, if you think to the least degree that Hillary Clinton has your best interest, you had better think again. She has been quoted stating her fact that the woman of this Country and many others are peasants, nobody's to do as their told. If you're thinking to cast one vote in her direction simply because she is a woman and she represents you as another woman, bad idea. She does not care for you and would not pass one law in favor of you. This is where she will try and win votes, is with the Woman of this Country. She will say whatever you would like her to say then just as you cast that vote for her she will turn and as your walking away,,,, STAB you right in your BACK... with every fiber of me I beg of you to reconsider voting for Hillary Clinton.. I have a dream of being able to financially take a leave of absence from my job and drive across the United states Of America and place in every mailbox DVD's of these movies your about to watch. And even stopping at every place she plans to speak and handing one out to all those in attendance.  Maybe Donald Trump would finance such a thing. But can you think of the protection I would need 24/7.  That would really piss the Clinton's off to no end. Please spend the time to watch these videos.  And pass this to all you know.   Wake up America before it's all too late             Thank you and God speed in this attempt to save what once was The United States Of America..                       https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mYW5nmS9ps              https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWL_NBJN5cA                  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvMLrhcpp9U                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwsRm3-qCSE                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KGlBHyVeYU",0,0,Hillary Lies,wuV4BCYv-YY,0.19659090909090907,2015-07-15 19:00:44,True,True

GET OVER IT! I've learnt not to judge till ive actually seen a movie. I, for one, think this trailer looks brilliant! you can't fault it! the graphics & CGI looks on point! & Miles Teller is one hell of an actor! it's such a shame how much bad press this movie got! i haven't even seen it yet but personally i feel it deserves more than what it's had. The criticism is beyond ridiculous. I hate how people expect too much from movies and go way into detail with who's ment to be playing who and what colour you're ment to be, to be able to play a certain character! if you were truly a marvel fanatic, you'd be more open about new idea's etc. just enjoy the action & humor! marvel gets taken way too seriously. give it another 10 years or less and they'll be making another movie with different actors & storyline again.",0,0,katty watty,wuV4BCYv-YY,0.029958762501865955,2015-10-30 03:59:01,False,True

2015-11-25T02:53:57,"The problem with these fantastic four movies is that they treat them like single hero films, for example they make Reed the main character. What needs to be done with fantastic four is give every member an equal part making the team the main focus of the film and not one singular being. Another thing is do not stray too much from the source material, for example stop trying to shoe horn Doctor doom into the first film with some convoluted reason for his powers and metal face. Not one film has had doom with his armour and not superpowers and it baffles me why they avoid it. His origin is too complex to be summarised justly in just one film. Spanning his origin over the coarse of two films with only cameos in the first and in depth in the second would work well.  What makes fantastic four is the family dynamic and dysfunctional relationship they have. More focus has been put on unnecessary childish comedy and action in the movies previously made then this aspect and it hinders your relation to the characters and you do not care for their well being by the end as the characters just seem like cardboard cut outs and not as believable people in any real danger. So to summerise 1. more emphasis on the family relationship 2. give an equal character development for each character 3. if your gonna use doom don't try shoe horn him in with some bull shit superpower, just give him his Armour and technology 4. fantastic four has more then one villain, they have a large rooster to chose from(Molecule Man, Frightful Four, Super Skrull,   Annihilus etc) so pick one we haven't seen before. 5. Make it fun and light heart, yet serious and action packed. This can be done just look at the avengers or ant man. After all the team consists of a giant rock man and a man on fire who can fly.
