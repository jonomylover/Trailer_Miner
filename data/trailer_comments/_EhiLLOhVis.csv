2017-10-06T17:19:06,"To everyone whining about the 'Weight' of the new Jaegers, I think you need to watch the trailers more closely. The main Jaegers are much smaller than the¬†ones from the first movie, or so it appears, as well as Uprising taking place 10 years after the first movie, meaning the Jaegers will be much faster and the movement much more refined, as the PPDC has obviously been spending a lot of time and money making these new Jaegers. And besides, there aren't as many moving parts to the jaegers, because, again, they've been refined and upgraded. And it you watch the final scene in the trailer where the Jaegers are charging at the mega-kaiju, you can see they're running in what would be slow-motion for a human. These Jaegers are still 10,000-ton hunks of metal, they've just been refined. You can still feel the weight behind every movement. Now, If we saw Jaegers sprinting like Usain Bolt and landing punches as quick as a professional boxer, I would be kinda cross, but I personally enjoy the designs of the new fleet.

Another thing about it being in daylight is that everything is TOO Visible when looking at these new more Disgusting and detailed Kaiju it just AH GOD MY EYES IT TO MUCH.

2017-10-06T17:44:40,"I've got a theory about the plot of this upcoming movie:  The main antagonists of the movie, the one that the heroes have a personal grudge against, are a group of tiny Kaiju-style parasites who infest human bodies, 'Drift' with the memories of their hapless hosts and act as spies and saboteurs for their masters.  This is my thought process, more or less:  --The narrative weakness of the Precursors, the aliens who made the Kaiju, is that they were rather vague and distant as villains: the heroes and the audience couldn't emotionally interact with them due to their alien nature, their residence in another dimension, and their brief appearance in the climax of Pacific Rim 1.¬† ‚ÄìPacific Rim 2 needs a villainous 'face' of some kind, a relatable antagonist that people can understand, get mad at, and even grudgingly respect. A body-snatcher who can pass as human fits that goal while still being terrifyingly alien. Done well, they can even be complex antagonists, sympathetic towards humans due to the memories they've absorbed, while still determined to fight for the survival of their own 'species'. ‚ÄìIt's also a wicked ironic reversal of the plot's premise: humans pilot giant robots to fight Kaiju, while Kaiju pilot humans to fight Jaegers. ‚ÄìThere's two interesting clips in this trailer that may support this theory: there's that brief snippet where a four star general lets out a face-distorting scream like the imposters from the 1970s 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers'. There's also the scene we see where Jaegers are fighting Jaegers: they may have discovered one of the Kaiju spies and are fighting to keep them from escaping with cutting-edge tech.

It‚Äôs a lil bright, maybe a lil to bright.

In the first film, hope was nearly lost, and there were a few Jaegers left. Now, people have hope again, and there are far better Jaegers, and btw, it makes perfect sense that they'd have better mobility, or work with one pilot, after a few years.  John Boega's character being Idris Elba's character's son(it seems like it), is just absolutely perfect.  The music, its a freakin' Tupac song, of course it fits. Its not some shitty pop song, its a song from Tupac.  Also, it looked like the Kaijus have Kaiju/Jaeger hybrids. It makes sense, they're intelligent, and they would adapt to the point of having Kaiju/Jaeger hybrids.   But I hope this doesnt mean Becket and Mako from the first film are killed off, and the Kaijus have Gipsy Danger. When I think about it, that would be perfect, the Kaijus would basically be flipping off the humans by using the very thing that was supoosed to end them.

The only thing I liked about the trailer is that it showed some corruption or one of the Jaegers betraying the government or something. I thought that was a pretty cool idea to include in the movie.

Plus in minute 1:42 to 1:44 you all can see the swarm of small kaiju is gathering towards three larger kaijus, in 1:45  to 1:51 they show us glimpse on how the merging is happen. We can see the smaller kaiju crawls in the boss kaiju body and forming its structure. If my theory is true, then this trailer is surely spoils us quite much.

2017-10-07T06:51:04,"Got to be honest. This trailer is not what I hoped it would be. The first minute of the trailer starts out really nice; shows some of the first war, shows the new Yeager's in action a bit, and tells us about what the world is like after the war by turning the Jaegers against one anther. Kinda like what humanity would actually do in this situation and I think is a solid idea for the plot. However the rest of the trailer kinda crumbles. We see more of Jaegers vs Jaegers and who can't complain about that but then there are just these random cuts of Kaiju scenes. At first I thought these were more flashbacks but we can later see these are new Kaiju attacks. The return of the Kaiju should be a big deal like a second coming of the apocalypse and yet there just kinda there. This makes feel like there no big deal anymore. The Kaiju were the main enemy of the first film so much so that they almost won the war but having them just apear in the sequel takes all the weight they had away. And I know that this is just a trailer and that they kaiju will probably have not only a bigger presence but a better reveal in the full film but mabye keep that reveal secret mabye not show us Kaiju till the second or third trailer if at all make them feel more like villains and less like a monster of the week. I don't care if they have some special powers or whatever there appearance should shock and terrify audiences. I hope the film is far better then this trailer because I'm a big fan of  the original pacific rim and it deserves a sequel that matches or even surpasses it but all and all this trailer does not give off that feel to me, it makes me think this film will not be as good as the original and I hope I'm wrong. It is the first trailer and the visuals and acting look great so I'm still holding out hope. But the soundtrack sucks I'm sorry but these songs have been terrible in my opinion.

You truly feel there is a steel titan walking around carrying the best humanity can offer and it means fking business, same as a kaiju where you can feel the threat of a megamonster, thousand tons of flesh unstoppable and rampant. Where is any of that in 2? Playdoll mechs wich seem to bemoving as fast as humans, seem smaller (probably are) and so seem the kaijus. Any combat scenario created under these premuses does not feel like a clash between gargantuans, but more like a clash between a human and bear, with the difference human bear sword type weapons.  -The mechs themselves. In pacific rim 1 you could tell the individuality of the mechs, they had ""character"" same as their drivers, who can forget the russians? One of my two complains in PR1 was that we didnt get to see much foghting from Russian and Chinese Jaeger, but we still got something and even that little was awesome. Do you remember any of the jaegers you saw in  PR2 trailer besides the gypsy danger evolution? I dont, while i was fighting with my eyes  in the first trailer to absorb ALL extra detail in the jaegers and kaijus, in the 2nd movie trailer i felt like i didnt care, i can see them clearly and yet the item of focus is their sword not their character.

Pacific Rim one was a movie wich just felt like a big love letter to all of the old school monster movies. This new movie looks like it missed that. It's too bright, it's too hopefull, too... doll. I see a lot of people referencing the transformers and the power rangers, and i think they're right. I cared for the futur and the well being of the caracters of the first one because even if i the plot was kind of stupid it was well made and i wanted to believe it. There is no stakes at hand in this one so there is no fear for the caracters . And teenagers... seriously what the hell... i know there is monsters and robots but that don't mean you should aim at kids!

The first one had this dark, brutal feel to it. The jagers were slower and they felt powerful watching them. As for the kaiju the fact that what we saw of them was in darker conditions we felt tension and they were intimidating. Along with this Gypsey dangers design had a very metallic grey look about it. In this trailer the Kaiju look pretty good, but seem less, idk, threatening, and the jagers remind me more of the new power rangers movie looks, from weapons, to how they move. Of course the power rangers movie isn't that bad, i enjoyed it because everything they did fit for power rangers, but for pacific rim it should more brutal. Remember how churno alpha always seems like a tank no matter what it was doing, even when we meet the pilots of alpha it's size and tank like look made it intimidating, that's what pacific rim is in my mind.",26,3,Wolfoe 3604,_EhiLLOhVis,0.06156299840510368,2017-10-07 14:09:47,True,True

Guillermo Del Toro, a brilliant visual stylist and great director, made Pacific Rim as a silly homage to the classic monster movies he watched as a child. It was never meant to be a big, epic film, it was just meant to be fun. The world of Pacific Rim was incredibly rendered, with expressive color grading and great special effects. The CGI was incredible, and masterfully blended into real world scenery in really interesting locales like Tokyo. This movie is just any big dumb blockbuster, with CGI that already looks dated and uninteresting locations for fights. So the CGI looks like crap, and the coloration of the images is very uninteresting. They also got a director whose literally only known for the Spartacus TV show to direct it, following up GUILLERMO DEL TORO, so that gives you an idea of the kind of quality they were seeking for this product.

Not only that, but it looks like they've completed stripped the human aspect behind each Jaeger, no pilot to pilot protocol sequence, no neural handshakes, and they've incorporated AI's which really don't fit the steam punk theme of the actual Pacific Rim universe.

This attitude is utterly stupid, if the film was to be realistic then it shouldn't exist in the first place because its whole premise is based on ludicrous and impossible feats: building 100 meter tall robots to fight giant monsters genetically engineered by an alien species. A director's creativity shouldn't be limited because of realism. If you want realism then don't watch the movie because there's no realism whatsoever in having genetically engineered giant monsters invade earth under orders of an interdimensional alien species and humans reacting by fighting back with 100 meter tall humanoid robots equiped with plasma guns.   I'm glad they're making the Jaegers move even faster because it means the studio is giving zero f*cks about those complaints that giant robot (mecha) and monster (kaiju) films have to be ""realistic"" in order to be produced. You see, this is what happened to Godzilla, they wanted to make it so realistic that it ended up being just an oversized animal fighting other animals when the original japanese Godzilla is more of an intelligent and sentient being that defends Earth from several threats that are either alien or man-made.",131,18,Octavio Garc√≠a,_EhiLLOhVis,0.0408289241622575,2017-10-08 16:00:49,True,True

2017-10-08T18:02:53,"Mixed reactions. I am a Pacific Rim fanboy, I loved the original movie, and have been impatiently waiting for the sequel.   The things that are wrong with it... cast is way too young... think back to the first film... the young people were inexperienced, lost their cool, and didn't quite have it together ... the older people naturally guided them through ... what are they going to do in this one? Call a suicide hotline? anyway...   Lets talk about the jaegers... in the first one, their weapons were more technologically realizable... seems like every movie today has glowing swords and electric whips.... what was wrong with missiles? normal knives that Striker Eureka had? Spinning shuriken things that Crimson Typhoon had? EMP bursts? Plasma bursts? Cherno Alpha had a giant tazer we never got to see!! And what about that solenoid powered punching arm?? All realizable... but in this one... what is with that overexaggerated drill bit??? What are they doing, looking for oil in the kaiju??? CMON MAN!!!   The speed doesn't bother me at all. If you remember, striker eureka could run in water... it was normal evolution. What is important is that they maintain the umph in theaters, because fast or slow its still a heavy machine moving around. When Gypsy Danger was walking around in the city looking for the acid spitty preggo kaiju, the glass would vibrate because of the jaegers steps... THAT is umph...   We'll see how it is in theaters.

No. Because after a while the slow moving motions would get boring. Sure, in the first pacific rim the weight of the jaegers added to the suspense, but it also kinda dragged the fight scenes down imo. A faster bot means it can react faster and have a better chance of winning.

Gypsy Danger was o.p. too if they took out two category 3 Kaijus and in one fight and a 5 couple days later but hey, it was fun to watch.",0,0,DJtickles,_EhiLLOhVis,0.28333333333333327,2017-10-09 02:16:22,True,True

I tried watching the trailer without the music and I noticed that my interpretation of what I was seeing changed drastically.  With the music, the movie is essentially selling itself as transformers or power-rangers (along with the color palette choice during the day-shots, but I think enough people have harped on the odd choice of day colors. When the music isn't big, orchestral, and powerful, the trailer is selling the movie short of its big and giant premise.   Continuing, the line-up shot at the end has the camera moving very quickly from one jaeger to another, which makes the jaeger's feel like they are tiny instead of being huge. Subtle stuff like this changes the tone of the movie very significantly.  I hope it's good, but there are a lot of things that are making me nervous (visual design choices are the main thing that are bothering me at this point).",121,16,PixelRelatedismyname,_EhiLLOhVis,0.12421875000000002,2017-10-09 15:34:05,True,True

The jaegar on jaegar action looks pretty good, but I can't help but feel this going to be one of those typical sequels that everyone forgets about. I would have preferred a prequel. Would've been wicked to see the mk.1's in action and it would have given them a better idea of how to move the franchise forward towards a story rich ending. The plot is off. It chops straight to where humanity is ready to duke it out with next gen jaegars. They hinted at the jaegar/kaiju hybrid in the first film and it would have been a better build up story to go through the process where the jaegar program is reinvented and refined in the time where the portal is restored or shortly after it is restored. It would have been a decent enough ending if we did not get a third movie and it could have set up an epic finale where it would have made sense to introduce an op regen kaiju.

2017-10-13T12:10:53,"Aright first of all, I'm not gonna lie the fight scenes look awesome and I'll be cheering at every one of them. But one of the biggest loses I think this movie has, is that it doesnt have the one thing that makes the scene from the first one  work so well. *Weight.*  The Jagers from the first movie seem to move so slow, like they are *actual giant robots* that has to cover some *actual distance* to deliver even a single punch. Even though they move so slowly, it's all worth it when the punch actually came in contact with the Kaiju because when that punch hits you can just *feel* how heavy it was, how damaging that single blow was to the Kaiju.  These new Jagers seem to move so fast and yeah their weapons look cool and all, but it's a shame that the impact is gone.  The first movie was brilliant, it's gritty and realistic, but it toes the edge of sci-fi too. It gives off the feel of a world capable of having robotic limbs and flying cars but also drug deals in an alley and murder in an abandoned parking lot.  I don't know what to expect from this movie, but I hope we can still see the alley ways in this sci-fi world.  *EDIT:* For the record let me say this for the people that commented this over and over again. It is not that I dont understand *why* the Jagers are so much more light in this sequel, what I'm saying is that *the weight that we see in the first movie REALLY sold it to not just me, but a way more wider audiance and it is a shame that we cant see that again in this movie*",352,34,leah fey,_EhiLLOhVis,0.16414390207493657,2017-10-13 12:10:53,True,True

2017-12-20T00:52:35,"In my opinion, this is probably going to be terrible.  The first movie was beautifully executed and dynamic with surprising amount of sentience with the human settings in a monster/robot fighting movie.  The sequel seems to be the complete opposite from what I'm seeing in the trailer.  The first and the worst mistake was kicking out Guillermo del Toro from the project for directing; in his visuals, he aims for good perspective that won't make the characters too close, close realistic physics of weight and height of the robots/monsters (slow movement indicated from the first movie) while executing movements. Not only that, but the signature colors of shades of blues with streaks of warm colors.  This version, it's just not believable in the execution, there's no limited palette/gamut technique, and the camera angles are already obnoxious in the trailers.  Aka, typical Hollywood maneuvers.  Thus, I'm going to watch this when it comes out on Netflix; not worth the tickets for the theater.

2020-04-05T16:18:12,"I don't know why this film has a lot of hate because I'm one of the few people who likes it. I can understand that they didn't get all the old actors from the first film to reprise their roles like Raleigh but that's probably because the actor would want lots of money to come back. Like in the MCU the actors who played Rhodey and Bruce Banner in their debut were later replaced by different actors because the old actors wanted more money and yet nobody complains about them now. The other issue people have is the CGI saying it looks bad but the first movie was always in shown in the dark but if it was shown more during the day you wouldn't complain. The next issue people have is how the jaegers don't have height to them and how you can't feel their hits like in the first film but you also have to remember that these are Mark 5 to 7 Jaegers and they're more advanced than the Mark 1 to 4 jaegers. They're not going to rebuild old jaegers to fight against newer kaiju that might have the advantage in battle. So they made newer models to keep up. And there's the issue that they look the same. I beg to differ, they look completely different to me. And people complain that kids are the ones piloting the jaegers. Are you serious I see nothing wrong with that, we've seen it done in hundreds of anime so why are you complaining now. The next issue is Stacker's son who was never mentioned in the first film. Maybe he was never mentioned was because his father probably disowned him after trying to pilot a jaeger by himself and failed. Next issue was killing off Mako and yes I will agree with that but remember what I said about actors needing money but it did serve as a good motivation for Jake to become a pilot and save the world. The next biggest issue was the kaiju were always heading for Mt. Fuji. Remember what Newton said in the first film the Precursors sent the Kaiju to attack cities to soften them up and then send the bigger threats. They were most likely trying to eliminate any threats that would interfere with their plans to take over the earth. The Kaiju's position of where they were at the time just happen to be towards the direction of Mt. Fuji.",1,0,TheToaprimezilla,_EhiLLOhVis,0.04065656565656566,2020-04-05 16:18:12,False,False
