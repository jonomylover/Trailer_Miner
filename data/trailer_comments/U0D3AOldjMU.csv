2017-05-24T09:07:51,"I get that they are trying to integrate Spidey into the MCU, and I understand they have to establish relationships between him and the other characters in the universe, but from what I'm seeing, I feel like they are tying the development of Spider-Man a little too closely to Tony Stark and the Avengers.  I mean, Stark is responsible for his suit, and when he doesn't have it, he wears a makeshift Spidey suit. A bit part of the plot seems to be him wanting to prove himself to the Avengers, kinda being Stark's coffee-boy in a way. From the looks of things, he hasn't handled any ""big deal"" villains yet, and Vulture will be the first. And taking on Vulture is kinda his way of proving himself to the Avengers.  I dunno, in the comics, the Avengers weren't so involved in the development of Spider-Man. Dude didn't become an official Avenger until pretty well into his career. By then, he had already had his ""official"" suit (not the rougher version he started with), had already invented impressive technology to aid him in his superheroic efforts (Spider-Tracers, for instance), and had already had most of his villains established.  I know that adaptations don't have to be identical to the comics and they should be judged on their own merits, but it really feels like it diminishes the character to make his coming-of-age so dependent on the Avengers. Like, the cool thing about Spider-Man was that, despite being a competent and effective hero, and even most people's favourite Marvel Comics hero in the real world, within his own world, his efforts went unrecognized. He's the hard-luck hero. Being Spider-Man was a thankless job, the public thinks him a menace, and even after going up against some of the baddest of the bad, he isn't very esteemed by the inhabitants of the Marvel Universe. It wasn't until he had already proved himself a million times over that he was finally bestowed with the honour of being an Avenger.  I think they could have still had references to the Avengers, but not let the movie hinge too much on them. Don't have Stark be so prominent in the early development of the character. In fact, if anything, it'd be cooler to see Spidey palling around with Daredevil or something.",0,0,thisxgreatxdecay,U0D3AOldjMU,0.16517857142857142,2017-05-24 09:07:51,True,True

I don't care about the Ultimate universe, the original comicbooks and older cartoons were more serious than that and fit into theme, which is darker than some may say). The movie may be another MCU creation that I forget about just after I finish watching it; it won't have a distinctive enough atmosphere nor will I care about its 2D characters.  That's what happens when your target audience is a bunch of kiddies... again. It may be a good film but nothing besides that. Will Holland be the best Spidey? Personally, I don't think so. I already don't like his PP, but, as of SM, I don't feel he is charismatic enough.

2017-05-24T11:32:57,"What is the point of his Spidey-sense then if you're just gonna give him another Jarvis in his suit?     Starting to feel like this isn't getting what makes Spider-Man, Spider-man.  First you hijack Miles Morales story and hand it to Peter Parker whom doesn't need it and has dozens of other stories you can take from without needing to do that.     And NOW you essentially make Spider-Man's suit into a cloth Iron-Man suit...      I still somehow find myself excited for this film, but it's not doing itself any favors completely negating the need for his spider-sense now with a ""do it all"" suit, which acts like Peter is somehow not competent enough to figure stuff out on his own.     He doesn't NEED all the freaking Stark tech in that suit, he's Spider-Man!     I really hope by the end of this movie if Stark tries to give him back the suit he rejects it.  He seriously, SERIOUSLY doesn't need all the techy stuff, he's NOT JUNIOR IRON-MAN.. he's SPIDER-MAN!     His suit somehow needing a ""Jarvis"" and all that extra techy stuff really puts me off more than I thought it would, and it's doing itself no favors. Spidey doesn't need all the bells and whistles that Iron-Man does, because he's powerful enough as it is, unless you're nerfing him and making him dependent on it -_- and you may as well nerf his super genius intellect too if you're going to do that.  Then he isn't Peter Parker at all at that point.    This feels less and less like a Peter Parker movie and more and more like it should have been a Miles Morales movie as the trailers go on, and that's not re-assuring to me a s a Peter Parker fan.  If you were gonna do all this extra stuff PETER would never need, you may as well have just made it a Miles Morales movie.   You already had Abraham Attah cast in the movie, and he could have EASILY been Miles Morales.

2017-05-24T13:40:10,"There a lot of better elements in this version of spider-man. First and the foremost, he ACTS like spider-man. I love Andrew Garfield, he even resembled spider-man a lot, but he didn't act out the character that good(according to me). But Tom has done a great job as spider-man in civil war and I feel that he's the best for spider-man. He looks like teenager (Andrew looked a bit old for a teenager) and also his voice kinda suits the personality of spidey.  Second thing, am really glad that there are new antagonists and new characters too, like The vulture, Liz Allen, Ned and Tony Stark. I really don't want to see uncle Ben getting shot again, or Peter Parker searching for the thief, or Gwen Stacy dying..... Third, there is an upgrade in his suit. Every movie till now showed spider-man in just a spandex(which later gets torn when the enemy attacks) I like the fact that the suit is upgraded to smart suit by Tony and can do more cooler stuffs, and I also love the fact that spider-man switches back to his old hoodie outfit later on.  This movie promises something new and fresh. Yeah, some people may say aunt May is too young, or that Tony Stark has too much spotlight and that the trailers reveal the main movie plot, but guys, we have to be patient, we haven't watched the movie yet, and we don't know, there might be something that's not in the trailers.

And here is the list That proves my point.  1: THE MOVIE IS 2 HOURS AND 10 MINUTES. So its going to have a lot more scenes that we haven't seen yet.  2: They didn't Show the Second Shocker in the film. and we don't even know why the Two Shockers are even in the film.  3: We don't even know that vulture is going to die or not.  4: The Movie will have Scenes of peter in high school. The Trailers didn't even showed that much of peter in high school and what he's dealing with in school.  Last reason: We don't even know if peters is going to get his suit back. i have 80% chance that he will probably but we don't know.  There are More reasons that i want to say but I'm tired of commenting.   My advice to people is that you should be positive and excited on a movie when it comes out and not complain about it and just wait if its good or not. Besides This is MCU, and i know that the MCU made bad movies before, but the MCU are now at the top of there game and they make good movies now, They know what there Doing.

Then I went to the reboot in 2012, and initially thought Andrew Garfield was better than Tobey Maguire. Now I've watched all 5 movies two months ago, and I've changed my mind. Tobey Maguire is the best Spider-Man I've seen. He's the most realistic. The reboots are getting old. At least when Superman Returns came out, it was 19 years after Superman 4. Man of Steel was only 7 years after that, and Henry Cavill is the best Movie Superman IMO. Batman. again, been around a very long time, 5 different actors spanning a longer period of time. Ben Affleck is the best and most realistic Batman IMO. I just pray that Tom Holland will be Spider-Man at least for the next decade.

This resonates with people because, in life, we don't always win and it sucks. But characters like Spider-Man inspire hope that there is something brighter if we just keep our head up, and that message has helped me through a lot.

2017-07-04T07:50:44,"In 2012,¬†Tony Stark¬†and the¬†federal government¬†create the¬†U.S. Department of Damage Control¬†(D.O.D.C.), driving salvage company owner¬†Adrian Toomes¬†out of business. Toomes convinces his colleagues to not surrender the¬†Chitauri¬†technology already scavenged from the Battle of New York and use it to further a criminal agenda.  Five years later, following the Avengers' internal dispute,¬†Peter Parker¬†resumes his studies after Stark tells him he is not yet ready to become an¬†Avenger. Over the objections of his¬†Aunt May, Peter quits his school's¬†decathlon¬†team in order to spend more time focusing on his ""Stark Industries¬†internship"", which is a cover for his crimefighting activities as Spider-Man.  One night, after preventing Toomes' associates from robbing an¬†ATM, Peter returns to his¬†Queens¬†apartment only for his best friend¬†Ned¬†to discover his secret identity. On another night, Peter comes across Toomes' associates¬†Herman Schultz¬†and¬†Jackson Brice¬†selling Chitauri weaponry to local gangster¬†Aaron Davis. When he tries to intervene, Peter nearly loses his life at Toomes' hands and is rescued by Stark. Toomes later kills Brice for jeopardizing the operation.  Retrieving a Chitauri weapon left behind by Brice, Peter works with Ned to remove the power core. A tracking device leads Schultz to¬†Midtown School, but Peter and Ned manage to evade him. After planting his own tracking device on Schultz and learning that it leads to¬†Virginia, Peter rejoins the decathlon team and accompanies them to¬†Washington, D.C.¬†for Nationals.  Working with Ned, Peter disables the tracker implanted in his Spider-Man suit and unlocks all its secret features. He later tries to stop Toomes from stealing weapons from a D.O.D.C. truck, but ends up being overpowered and trapped inside the truck, causing him to miss Nationals. When he discovers that the Chitauri power core is unstable, Peter tracks Ned to the¬†Washington Monument, arriving just as the core explodes and traps Ned in an elevator. Evading local authorities, Peter manages to save Ned and fellow classmate¬†Liz¬†before the elevator plummets.  Returning to¬†New York City, Peter persuades Davis to reveal Toomes' whereabouts. Confronting Toomes and his associates at the¬†Staten Island Ferry, Peter captures the group's new buyer¬†Mac Gargan¬†while Toomes escapes after a malfunctioning weapon tears the ferry in half. Stark helps Peter save the passengers before admonishing him for his recklessness and taking the suit away. While picking up Liz for Midtown's annual homecoming dance, Peter learns that she is Toomes' daughter. Deducing Peter's secret identity, Toomes threatens retaliation if he continues to interfere with his plans.  During the dance, Peter realizes Toomes is planning to hijack a D.O.D.C. plane transporting weaponry from¬†Avengers Towerto the team's new headquarters in¬†upstate New York. Leaving the dance and donning his homemade Spider-Man suit, Peter is ambushed by Schultz only for Ned to save him. Peter then confronts Toomes in his lair, who attempts to persuade him to his side. When Peter refuses, Toomes destroys the building's support beams and leaves him to die.  Managing to escape, Peter intercepts Toomes onboard the now-damaged plane, steering it towards the beach near¬†Coney Island. The two engage in a confrontation that ends with Peter saving Toomes' life and leaving him for the police.  Sometime later, Peter learns that Liz is moving away and that classmate Michelle Jones ‚Äì whose nickname is ""MJ"" ‚Äì will be replacing her as president of the decathlon team. Peter later declines Stark's invitation to join the Avengers and inspires Stark to bring an¬†engagement ring¬†to a press conference where¬†Pepper Potts¬†is present. Upon returning home, Peter discovers that Stark has returned his upgraded suit and puts it on just as May walks into his room.  In a mid-credits scene, an incarcerated Gargan approaches Toomes at¬†the Raft¬†and explains that several criminals are¬†banding together¬†to exact vengeance against Spider-Man. In a post-credits scene,¬†Captain Americatakes part in a¬†public service announcementcentering on the importance of patience.

I would buy his toys, his masks, dress up as him, pretend to be him, watch his tv shows, sing his theme songs etc. As a kid I thought he was the most awesome guy ever. The wat he swings, fights, talks, and acts all seemed so incredible, and the life that he lives always interested me. I could never explai. Why honestly. It wansnt just the amazing and awesome city that he lived in, or his super powers, his bravery, his courage, his will, care for others, and so on. Well....I guess it is. But it us the fact he is so relatable and you are able to connect with him, especially as a kid. He is a dude that is living a normal life besides the Super Hero stuff. He is a kid, goes to school, faces family and friend issues, does homework, studies, explores, and has fun. He is just a normal guy. That is what I love about him, he is like us. He proves, besides the super powers, that anybody, no matter what age can be a hero to protect the city, family, friends, and home that he loves. His battles mentally and physically have always inspired me, and still do to this age. No words can describe how much I love Spider-Man, and how excited I am for this film. This is one of my most hyped up films ever! Everytime I struggled as a kid, I would look at him, out myself in his shoes, and become Spider-Man. The reason why I was able to find it is because Spider-Man lives inside of me. He lives inside if all of us. I said it before and I will say it again.....SPIDER-MAN IS THE GREATEST SUPERHERO EVER! Tom is perfect for Spider-Man! He will join the likes of RDJ, Ryan Reynolds, and Hugh Jackman for the best Superhero castings of all time. This is the Spider-Man we want!

2017-07-07T22:27:29,"I JUST SPIDERMAN-HOMECOMING! I ADORED IT! I loved this film so much I cannot describe it. I was crying with tears of joy, and had a big and young smile on my face througout the whole film! It was just incredible and this movie means a lot to me. I love this hero so much you all do not even know. I grew up with Spider-Man ever since I could remember. I would buy his toys, his masks, dress up as him, pretend to be him, watch his tv shows, sing his theme songs etc. As a kid I thought he was the most awesome guy ever. The wat he swings, fights, talks, and acts all seemed so incredible, and the life that he lives always interested me. I could never explai. Why honestly. It wansnt just the amazing and awesome city that he lived in, or his super powers, his bravery, his courage, his will, care for others, and so on. Well....I guess it is. But it us the fact he is so relatable and you are able to connect with him, especially as a kid. He is a dude that is living a normal life besides the Super Hero stuff. He is a kid, goes to school, faces family and friend issues, does homework, studies, explores, and has fun. He is just a normal guy. That is what I love about him, he is like us. He proves, besides the super powers, that anybody, no matter what age can be a hero to protect the city, family, friends, and home that he loves. His battles mentally and physically have always inspired me, and still do to this age. No words can describe how much I love Spider-Man, and how happy I am. This is one of my most hyped up films ever! Everytime I struggled as a kid, I would look at him, out myself in his shoes, and become Spider-Man. The reason why I was able to find it is because Spider-Man lives inside of me. He lives inside if all of us. I said it before and I will say it again.....SPIDER-MAN IS THE GREATEST SUPERHERO EVER! Tom is perfect for Spider-Man! He will join the likes of RDJ, Ryan Reynolds, and Hugh Jackman for the best Superhero castings of all time. This is the Spider-Man we want! This film was amazing and is a great to every Comic Book and even movie can put there. Finally after so long they got it right, and thank the lord Sony gave the rights back to Marvel! Let's start off with the actors. THEY WERE ALL GREAT...most of them. What can I say about Tom Holland that I along with everyone have not said already! HE IS INCREDIBLE AS SPIDEY! Not only is he incredible, but he is the best Spider-Man ever, and the best Spider-Man we will ever have. The way he talks, his emotions, his life, his age, his humor, his wittyness, his passion, live, care, and the way he acts is just perfect! He really shows how he was destined to be Spider-Man and Peter Parker! He has some emotional scenes that were done extremely well, but where he shines is his childlike behavior. For so long we have gotten Super Heros that hate their powers and life, and see them as a burden they have to carry. It is so nice and fresh to finally have someone who is happy and excited with their powers! Let's be honest, if we found out we had super powers, we would go crazy. And that is exactly what happens to him! Peter/Tom/Spidey go nuts about his powers, and he gets so anxious, happy, excited, and yes even childish with them! Exactly how Spider-Man should be, especially considering that he is a young kid. They play it realistically, which makes him even more relatable. He is immature and young with his powers, so everything is a thrill ride and learning experience for him, and to watch that is just amazing. And yeah he messed up.......in so many waysüòÇüòÇBut that is hilarious and sad to watch, and it is done extremely well. Peter along with the other kids of the film....act like kids! It was great to see! It is like going to a regular High School and going through your day. It seems real and relatable. They act like young kids going through their daily lives and that was so satisfying to see. Tom Holland is spectacular as Spider-Man and Peter Parker! I said it from the begining, HE IS THE BEST SPIDER-MAN EVER! Zendaya was great in this film! She was not in it too much, but she delivered extremely well. She was hilarious and added something unique to the film. She added mystery, humor, and something else I cannot put my finger on....BUT I LOVED HER! Michael Ketton was awesome in this! I loved his motivation and how interesting he was. He is soooooo menacing! You understand where he is coming from, but he scares the shit out of youüòÇ Michael was awesome as Vulture! Marisa Tomei is great as Aunt May! She cares for Peter so much, and she emotionally grips you with her love for Peter. She is funny, charming, caring, attractive and extremely protective. She is perfect for Aunt May and her scenes with Peter are great! Jacob Batalon was great as Peter's best friend! He was hilarious and made everyone in the audience laugh! Tony Revolori was a different Flash, but he was good. Not in it for too long, but he was good. And Robert Downey Jr....you all knew he was going to be great like come on he never faiis as Tony. He is a mentor and Father Figure for Peter, even though he is not ""the best"" at it. He is still a little bit of a sick to Peter, but you can tell he cares so much about him. He shows up when he messes up and tries to set him straight. His scenes with Peter are amazing to watch and it feels so real and capturing. It feels like a father is setting his son straight. That is their relationship, Father and son. RBJ/Tony was great in this film. He is not in it for that long, and you see more Tony Stark than Iron Man, but he delivers as always. Now he is a negative. Luara Harrier is not bad in the film, but she seems so forced and randomly placed their. I feel she serves no real purpse in the film and that she was just placed their for a love story. I was not a fan of the romance, but I understood it and appreciated it is that makes sense.       The action was superb and had an exciting atmosphere that created a very fun and crazy tone. The style of action and fighting really brought another mostly fresh take and door opening to the MCU. A lot of exolosions, alien guns, missles, , web slinging, punching, hard hits, and more was included in the film, and man was it awesome! I have always loved the way Spider-Man fights. To see him beating up bad guys, swinging from building, flipping, and so on was just thrilling! The action scenes were fantastic and the way their were filmed and choreographed was amazing. Loved the action! The movie looks splendid and solid too. You really feel like you are in New York City with him swinging or walking around. All the set pieces and locations they picked were spot on and incredible. The action was what I like to call ""Spider-Man"" action, which is the most or some of the most unique Comic Book action and action in general you will ever see. Every action sequence felt real yet Comic Book like. This movie is ridiculously fun, like I mean this is one of the most fun and entertaining films in a long time or ever! I had a blast watching this film, to the point where my be in exploded (not really but it felt like it did)! I was incredibly entertained watching this movie! And my God is this film hilrious!? THE WHOLE AUDIENCE WAS DYING FROM LAUGHTER EVERY SECOND! I was not able to breathe! It is incredibly funny, charming, witty, clever, and unexpected! Every joke landed for me, and that last scene.....THAT LAST SCENEüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇIT WAS SO UNEXPECTED AND CLEVER! It shocked the packed auditorium, but we alI died of laughter. I have not laughed that hard in a long time! That is one of my favorite movie endings for a Comic Book movie ever, or movie ever. AMAZING! And also note that my audience was gasping at certain parts! Their is a moment in the film that is so unexpected and shocking, THE WHOLE AUDEIENCE GASPED AND WAS TALKING! I heard a few people say something like ""OH SHIT""!I LOVE THAT SCENE! Seriously like I am going to remember that moment because of the atmosphere, reaction, and scene. It was so tense!       All in all, I FRICKIN LOVED SPIDER-MAN:HOMECOMING! It is one of my favorite comic movies ever and one of my favorite movies in a long time. I recommend everyone to go check this movie out, if you weren't going to already for some reasonüòï. If your a comic book fan or movie fan, this movie will blow your hearts away and satisfy you. A great film that anyone can love. Great Job to the cast of Spider-Man:Homecoming for the great marketing, promoting, interviews, merchandise, hype, and overall great movie. Thank you Marvel for giving out another hit and saving Spider-Man! This is one of the best Comic Book movies ever, the best film of the summer so far, and the best Comic Book movies in years. The perfect Spider-Man movie, and damn near a perfect film!

2017-07-09T01:36:37,Just came back watching Spider-man. It was great. Love the diversity. I brought my two youngest and it was nice to see diversity on screen especially when Spidey lives in Queens. Those who keep bashing the new movie that its not white enough can watch all the old spidey movie. The world does not revolve around your color anymore. Hence why the NWO will eventually prevail. I want my children to see themselves in the these movies and not all white. And guess what  they kept Spider man white so cry me a freaking river. These white are always whining. You got your white President. Sorry the world is not white. I can go into bashing but I am not. Just want to say the new movie was great. I never like the old spider man movies. They were boring and not relatable for me  but this movie was very relatable and heartfelt. And I will see it again. America is diverse and the new movies if they want to do well in this country and internationally need to reflect the diversity of this planet.,3,0,Luke Tran,U0D3AOldjMU,0.08735177865612646,2017-07-09 01:36:37,False,True

It's reasonable given he is still very inexperienced to the entire thing, and it creates quite a few funny moments, at least to me it is.

But it would have been nice to have seem a bit of it.   -The direction/pacing wasn't that all that well, they need to speed it up.  -They should have give Michael Keaton more screen-time. I guess since The Dark Knight. You'd think that you'd want the Hero and Villain to go more closely toe-to-toe with each other.  -They went a little too much with giving it the John Hughes tone/homages. Geez, does every high school movie need the John Hughes tone.  -Not strong memorable action scenes. Sam Rami's films are still on top with that.  -NO MENTION OF UNCLE BEN!!!! Have can you have a Spider-Man movie without any mention of Uncle Ben. The fuel that drives Peter to be Spider-Man.

I freaking loved this movie and it was definitely better than the Amazing Spiderman movies. However I don't think this is the best Spiderman movie that title goes to SpiderMan 2. Michael Keaton's performance as the Vulture was awesome and is definitely how a villain should be played not with what they did to the Green Goblin or Venom. Tom Holland is a perfectly balanced Peter Parker and Spidey. Note that despite this movie it doesn't change my love for Sam Raimi's films cause that was my childhood for Spiderman along with Spectacular Spiderman and Ultimate Spider-Man comics. Now for comics I this movie is pretty close to them, I myself am a big reader, and I know there some things in the movie that were changed but that doesn't make the movie worse. After watching this movie I felt like going home and watching the 1994 and Spectacular Spider-Man series and read all my comics cause that is how much nostalgia this movie brought me.

2017-07-11T23:39:17,"I've seen ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" and it was so good. A very fresh ""Spider-Man"" film that combines into a high school and blended into a new MCU style. Tom Holland is fantastic as the new MCU's Spider-Man/Peter Parker. I would say that he's a big star in his role model. So likable, very kid friendly, so tough New Yorker kid, and his style takes a whole new level since he done his portrayal in ""Civil War"" and now he adapts his character for much younger audiences and teens alike. I enjoy the characters including the young teens were like super nerd kids of around 2010's and they seem fit in. That's fine because they are teenagers. That's what they do for their attitudes and struggling for their emotions and being as a stuck up kid like Peter does. The villain is good including Michael Keaton as Vulture and he's great as always. An old Batman is in this town. The villain scheme of electronic smuggling is good and the emotions were so good. And watching ""Spider-Man"" in the big screen it's coming back like a good old campy ""Spider-Man"" style and being swagger at the same time is always good.

I don't necessarily like superhero movies and don't watch them that much (watched only the first movie about superman, 1 season of arrow, whole Flash tv show, all Spider-man movies and that basically it), but THIS! THIS was amazing.  Okay so I'm literally giving everyone who asks ""what was the movie like?"" a huge review and lots of Tom Holland interview bits (Yeah, Tom Holland is my new crush, mock me), but here I'm just gonna talk about one scene, since it was my ultimate favourite. Why am i gonna talk about it here? Don't know. Honestly, no idea. LIVE WITH IT.  So, the audience in the cinema was acting pretty crappy. They wouldn't stop talking about everything BUT the movie, they literally didn't pay attention to anything on screen and laughed at serious moments. For me, like a person actually enjoying the movie it was SO uncomfortable. But remember that part where Peter was stuck under a pile of rubble? When Peter found out that he was stuck and started screaming and literally crying for help - the audience finally shut up and started watching. Because you suddenly realise how small, how young he is, how scared he is, how actually helpless he is.   I never feel like crying at movies (unless its a Joss Whedon movie), but this scene almost made me tear up. Usually we don't see our heroes struggle in that kind of way. We see then lose someone very close, we see them fail in epic battles... we don't see them getting stuck under a pile of rubble and we don't see them cry for help so damn helplessly. Thats something all of us, non-heroic people would do, and thats something new in a superhero movie to me.  Then, finally, Peter finds the strength to get his way out, and the whole audience started cheering. Never seen that happen in my whole entire life. And thats it. Peter didn't do anything heroic in that scene, he got him self in a trap, he got himself out...   But thats when ""Spiderman: Homecoming"" became something deeper then a simple comedy to me.",14,1,Little Fox,U0D3AOldjMU,0.1217304625199362,2017-07-14 05:57:39,False,True

Since when is Spider Man tony's little bitch, why does he look like a 10 year old and where the hell are his spider sences. Spider Man only gets an advance suit like that when he joins Tony, much later during the Civil War. Flash who is supposed to be a bully and part of a sports team, is a smart, Idian douche bag, Mary Jane is a half black emo genuis when she's supposed to the hottest girl in the school who wants to become an actress. Mary Jane is smart but not a genuis like Peter. Spider Mans first girlfriend is actually supposed to be Gwen Stacy, not some random daughter of a villian who he never sees again in the end. In the end it was actually an explosion that defeated the Vulture not Spider Man. Spider Man spent more time getting his ass handed to him and asking Tony what to do. Overall, a shit film and a great way to ruin a great character. üëèNice one Mavel. The Amazing Spider Man films are still by far so much better and way more accurate than this shitty film. The only part I enjoyed were the jokes and the not so secret ending. Please bring back Andrew, he is still the best Spider Man.

But Spiderman has had his own upbringing and growing into a hero, why the hek did they make Ironman the so called hero that helps him.  Spiderman is more a hero than he is.  I loved Ironman movies and his character, but getting sick of him from Civil War to this.  And Spidermans suit that talks like Ironmans suit, hek Spiderman has his own ways and suits with his own advanced spider senses so why the hek did Ironman get involved, I dont like it.  Ironman shows he has too much daddy issues, Spiderman doesnt as he had his uncle that brought him up that he always thought about.  Marvel stop putting Ironmans daddy issues on everyone else.",0,0,And Its Me,U0D3AOldjMU,0.3485714285714286,2017-07-20 13:46:53,False,True

Claro que aqu√≠ no sale su origen y lo de la picadura de la ara√±a, porque eso es algo que ya sabemos y hemos visto millones de veces, me agrada que ya no lo retomaran porque se volver√≠a aburrido, esta pel√≠cula es una manera de introducir al Hombre Ara√±a al universo de los Vengadores y de Marvel, lo hicieron muy bien!  Adem√°s fue agradable la diversidad de los personajes, no se sigui√≥ el mismo estereotipo o como los conocemos en las series o comics, por ejemplo con Flash.  Tom Holland hizo un gran trabajo üíï  Tobey tambi√©n se luci√≥ y puede que para todos sea el mejor Hombre Ara√±a tal vez porque crecimos con sus pel√≠culas o fue asombroso ver a este personaje en la pantalla grande, pero creo que Tom Holland volvi√≥ a darle vida al personaje, para mi ellos dos son geniales como el Hombre Ara√±a logran darle su personalidad, y carisma  (De Andrew ni siquiera voy a hablar üòí ¬øen qu√© estaban pensando?)

As someone who went and saw the movie and loved it, I really wondered why people thought that about something I saw so special? So I talked to 7 people over the internet who have this view and I pretty much got the same response: Peter really wasn't saving something huge, Vulture wasn't directly killing anyone and a lot of the movie was about Peter and not so much about ""classic Spider-Man"" such as the one Toby played. I thought about this, and yeah that's true, but Spider-Man is supposed to be this light-hearted guy. A 15 year-old that you just dropped SUPER POWERS on. Yeah he didn't save NYC or hell, even the WORLD, But this is the first Spider-Man movie of 3. It gives him room to grow in the next 2 movies as well as in Avengers: Infinity War. THAT'S when he helps save the world. I personally think the movie was so amazing because I can't wait to see how Peter grows, and not have the same story over and over.",354,20,Frostnip7,U0D3AOldjMU,0.17305194805194807,2017-07-27 04:51:02,False,True

I very much regret that but I can't help how I feel about my favorite super hero and character of all time. I'd say that my biggest gripe with the movie (still), is the fact that there weren't that many intense swinging / action scenes. In the other films it seemed as if we got lots of that but unfortunately that's not what makes a good movie. This movie's story and overall tone was fantastic. It gave a more Ultimate spin on Spidey and I think that's what works best for the MCU. Despite what my nostalgia says and how I feel for the other films, I know that this is the best on screen representation of Spider-Man. It completely captures what Spidey is all about. It's more so about progression and growing rather than instantly knowing how to do everything and thats a hell of a lot better than a couple ""swinging"" scenes. It's fresh and new, exactly what we wanted. It'll be really cool to watch this film in order with the future ones to see how much he grows into the older more experienced Spider-Man.

Tom Holland did a great job at tackling the role of the web slinging teenage hero, but his character seemed clumsy compared to Civil War. It seems like he has no idea what he is doing even though he took on Captain America and Bucky. Also, Peter doesn't need all the high tech gadgets to be spiderman, you could almost have anyone take his place if he is going to rely on the tech of the suit. I felt Tony was a nuissance and pointless to the story line since Peter is the one who should create his own suit and web shooters.*like the other movies and comics* The high school scenes also had me falling asleep at times.

2017-09-10T23:24:41,- Movie was good and i really enjoyed it. A little different take on Toomes as Vulture but it was cool. With possibility of seeing maybe Scorpion or Shocker in next one. I just would like to see others villains than all those well known like Green Goblin or Venom. As much as i totally love Venom and he is my favourite character i would love to see maybe someone we didn't see in all those movies that came out in a past years so it doesn't feel like just a remake of villains we already seen. Even if movie is great and I'm sure it will be more than average if they gonna make another take on Green Goblin for the third time it might feel a little bit boring. My pick would someone like Kraven The Hunter or Morbius for example,0,2,Narama,U0D3AOldjMU,0.12083333333333329,2017-09-10 23:24:41,False,True

2018-05-06T12:41:54,"(almost) Exactly midway through the movie, you can see the portrait of the writer Franz Kafka. This is one of the greatest abstractions of all time. Whoever says Marvel movies are stupid just does not have a fine resolution. The reason it's a great abstraction: this movie is a reference not only to ""The Metamorphosis"" which talks about a man who turned into a bug that tries to hide itself from other people, but to at least another literary piece: ""The Trial"". In one of the chapters of this short story, the protagonist attempts to enter a court to argue against an accusation brought upon him, but an intimidating gatekeeper does not allow him to enter yet. After waiting many years in front of the door, the dying man asks the gatekeeper: how come nobody tried to go through the door but me? The gatekeeper, seeing that the man became frail replied that this door was only assigned to him. He then closes the door and leaves. The ending of spiderman is opposite to that in a sense that Peter Parker thought that Tony Stark was testing him and that he had no intention of making him one of the Avengers. At the end, you can see that Tony, Pepper and Happy were euphoric and relieved that the kid said ""No"". Tony even gave the kid a perfunctory chance. Another way in which this movie was kafkaesque is that Peter never kissed his crush and she had to leave (instead Tony kissed Pepper Pots).",0,0,TheSphinx,U0D3AOldjMU,0.14635416666666667,2018-05-06 12:41:54,False,False

And immediately Dukakis answered,  'No, I would not.  You know my position on the  death penalty - it is not a proven deterrant ...'  ( On matters of the heart, you never go with  your brain.  How do you not know that? )  But  Dukakis was like, 'I still don't get it.  I answered   the question, correctly.  And honestly.  Was I  supposed to feign hesitancy, unsuredness, or   lie?  It was a question that called for a simple   binary response - yes, or no. True, or false.   One or Zero.  What did I do wrong?'  ...

So, a major corporation - an arms dealer in fact - teams up with the Federal Government and runs around all-powerful, while the average Joe who gets his legal government contract pissed on and takes steps to survive - he is the bad guy? In this movie, the flippant comment from the government dweeb about 'in future don't over extend yourself' - well, he wasn't over extending himself, he had a contract in his hand and in theory that should be rock solid. However, the law apparently doesn't apply to the little guy (also in real life). So the lesson here is what - that major corporations are running around with our best interests at heart? What is that, some kind of joke right? That if you are the little guy getting shat on by the government-corporate machine, that you should just accept that?
