I personally am a Deist, but I think this could be an interesting take on it, if they do it in a balanced way.   It doesn't seem like it, considering Professor Radison seems like a cliche mean teacher/atheist archetype. Kevin Sorbo used to be an infamously bad actor, at least that seems to have improved. ",8,1,Yamantaka Elegy,Mqf5gAYcFWs,0.020833333333333353,2014-02-25 22:02:48,True,True

It's as simple as that. Therefore, the non-believer cannot be blamed for the failure of whichever Church, Mosque or Temple he/she came from & was most likely indoctrinated into shortly after birth. Indoctrination especially, as it is the equivalent to suddenly finding yourself in an arranged marriage already pre-dictated by your parents.  Nevertheless, the current denial of certain scientific discoveries has very little to do with discrediting science & mostly (if not everything) to do with preserving a belief system that is very much at risk of being debunked. This is why they (Evangelical Fundamentalists for the most part) despise secularism. After all, they have a history of counteracting everything secular by offering alternative rip-offs of things you would often see in the entertainment industry. Also, by them making the very nonsensical claim that science dodges a theistic or supernatural explanation, they follow it up with another rip-off alternative. It's called ""Creation Science.""

I may not be perfect, but I strive to be like Jesus (who was perfect). Now that you know my angle of bias, I will try to be unbiased in the rest of the comment.  To Christians: I enjoy your support of the movie. I support it as well. However, ""Bible bashing"" the non-Christians is not very loving, which is the whole foundation of Christianity - John 3:16. Boasting about the movie and its greatness won't do anything to promote the movie, if anything it will keep people away from the movie. The point of the movie is to get people aware of God and open their minds so that they can make the choice on their own, not having it forced upon them.  To Atheists and others: This movie is not meant to be a direct representation of what will happen. The movie shows extremes of each side, which allows space in the middle for people to agree on. ""I'm not that extreme."" It also shows just one reason for a person to declare himself/herself an ""atheist,"" not all, or even the most ""pure"" reasons. The other thing is that people are commenting on the idea that professors don't actually do this. I'm not saying that no one goes this extreme, or that no one prejudices against Christians (or  any other religion) in the classroom, especially college, I'm just saying that the end of the movie has many court cases where the student had to defend their faith against a professor.

Like the Muslim guy being painted as the bad guy, the ""New Left"" lady being grossly incompetent, and the Philosophy teacher making some obvious blunders that no one would likely make. The movie was so right wing, I'm surprised you got any minorities to appear in it. The story isn't even real. It exaggerates The Cause to a point where rational people will likely dismiss it. The movie seems to be a tutorial to the party base. Reinforcing the Political bulkheads are we? In discussing God, the real should never be exaggerated as it eventually renders a story silly and ludicrous. My challenge to you is to answer for supporting a movie that seems to be ignoring the tenets on which Christianity was founded on.

Here's the wager: If you can legitimately explain yourselves, I'll buy tickets for my girl and I to go to your next concert when you visit in nor-cal.

2014-04-15T02:23:59,"I told myself I wouldn't get involved but here goes. Take a look at the universe. This giant, expansive, seemingly never ending place we live. From what I understand, most atheists believe in the ""Big bang"" theory. It basically states that the universe was small and hot, then it was like popcorn and kind of exploded into the giant place we try to understand today. Basically, what I'm hearing is that the universe was  small and made itself something large. Where did that small thing come from? Oh I know. It came from an even smaller thing right? Or is that not it? Wait, you don't know? But weren't you there? You weren't? Then why do you believe it if there isn't any proof? What solid proof can you give me of the Big Bang? What person do you know has been alive since then? How many pictures do you have of it happening? You don't have it? Oh! You must have a video! Of course! Wait, you don't? So you're saying that you have no proof? So you're saying that you're having... FAITH? But don't you people put people down for having faith? What about evolution. Give me examples of that. I wanna know how I turned from a fish or a monkey or something into a human. ""Oh yeah those finches on the Galápagos Islands changed their beaks"" But they're still birds right? So you're having FAITH in the scientific community? Oh. Those guys must have kept a journal from when they were monkeys, right? ""But a God who lets all this stuff happen to the world isn't a good God so that means he's either not there or he's just as bad as Satan"" God gave us all something called ""free choice"". If you decided to nuke the world, would God stop you? Of course not, because we have free choice to make our on decisions. We made our world crappy ourselves, not God. We sin. We all sin. A lot. The only human being to never sin is Jesus. He took away all of your evils that you have done and he still loves you. Because of him, you can go to heaven and live forever and be in constant joy! I've seen too many comments disrespecting Jesus. So... Think of it this way. A random gunman breaks into your house at night and he is about to shoot you. Your (insert family member here) jumps in front of you to save you and then dies. You live safely. What do you do to your (insert family member here)? You bury them and remember them fondly and remain grateful. Sinners represent the gunman, sin represents the bullet, and Jesus gave his life to save yours. All he wants is for you to confess your sins and give them to him and remember him so you can be safe from Satan. Jesus can save you but you have to LET HIM. We are all criminals, God is the judge. Jesus paid our bail now all we have to do is confess our crime and God will dismiss our case and we go free. If you don't confess your sins, God has no choice but to uphold the law and you go to jail (hell). My rant's over. Thanks for reading and I hope I changed your beliefs somehow. One last thing to say. You probably always hear that Jesus loves everyone and that is why he died. ""Well gee, it sure was nice of that guy to die for all of us people."" Think of his love this way.

It's a screenplay and of course it does show the extreme situations which sometimes do exist but not every day , may be.  I've never heard that anyone would say about Lars von Trier movie that it's ""unreal"" (although someone cuts off her genitals). So those so called critiques just refer to this movie as unreal, just because it has some christian themes in it. Yes , it's not as shocking but it is still a film with plot inspired by real events not a reconstruction of a real event .- for example , my sociology professor claimed that there are no famous theist sociologists and those who are, are not reliable - that's a bit brave idea, coming from an objective university professor, isn't it? So there is some truth in it.  Somehow people block themselves and become blinded by hate when it comes to christian-themed movies and critisize the things they wouldn't mention about other films. So much for that so-called ""reason"" and ""rational thinking"". I understand some philosophical and moral arguments for atheism but I utterly disgust that ""New Atheism"" wave - band of liberal socialists who don't try to help the world any way, but just waste their whole life on arguing and whining about everything.

I think that science should deal with materia only. God is not materia, religion might be  handled as a sociological process but proving or disproving concept of God itself with scientific arguments is equally dumb. But there are much greater arguments for believing and not believing (this movie covered only few of them) so I think  ""God is dead"" is entirely philosophical-sociological argument and should be handled that way - no point of quoting scientists who deal more with materia than philosophy. If they question philosophical arguments as well made by those scientists, then it's justified.  And you start a debate with defining the keywords not with defining a Big Bang Theory if the subject is ""God is/not dead"". But I've heard that dumb argument from my professor too , that ""All the great thinkers were atheists!!!!"" HOW did this person defend his master thesis???? This is just untrue.

2014-05-27T20:47:52,"WHY ATHEISTS HATE GOD  Most atheists do not hide the fact that they are openly hostile and even hateful to both God  and Christians. Their  open hostility to God  is a result of ignoring and fighting the conviction  that the Holy Spirit has placed on their hearts. This is the reason they feel discomfort  and even anger  when they talk about this subject.    It is also the same reason why so many atheists flock to Christian videos on YouTube (like this one), and Christian web sites , like moths to a lamp - because the only way they are able to stop the conviction the Holy Spirit has placed on their hearts is to war with the Holy Spirit - continually.   They fight God with every breath in their bodies in a desperate hope that the conviction of guilt that they feel in their souls will be abated by a victory in an argument with a Christian .  But the feeling of adulation at name calling and demonization of Christians is stowed away but only  for a short time. Soon the feeling of conviction returns  - and so, like the addict seeking a fix,  the atheist returns to christian You Tube videos and other Christian web sites and attempts to abate his conscience once again.  But the atheists open hostility and anger only confirms for Christians the reality of God while they continue arguing against His existence.  If you are an atheist I pray that you come to the end of yourself having tried to fill the emptiness in your heart with all you could get your hands on and finally realize only Christ can fill that void.

This movie from start to finish is a deliberate contrivance in order to create a basis for Christian propaganda. In the four years of a bachelor's program and the two years of a masters, religion was a common topic. English and American literature is absolutely flooded with Christian influence, symbols, metaphors, allusions, etc. You cannot understand English and American literature without a sound knowledge of the Bible. In the six years of my studies, not once did the existence of god come up as a matter of debate. Religious institutions, dogmas, ideologies, and figures were a frequent topic, but never was the legitimacy or illegitimacy of the existence of any deity ever discussed. This movie is a farce. It's built upon a complete misunderstanding of Nietzschean philosophy, and there is a utter disregard for atheist argument. Any professor who did what this movie suggests would have been fired in violation of FICA. Not only has everything the student argues been answered repeatedly by several past philosophers like Nietzsche, Voltaire, and David Hume, but it has been reinterpreted and furthered by New Atheists such as Dawkins, Hitchens, and Harris. All the arguments against god that are presented are infantile and hardly represent current atheistic argument. None of the atheistic arguments and counter arguments are ever addressed, much less rebuffed. This movie is as much propaganda as Capra's Why We Fight or Riefenstahl's Triumph des Willens (Triumph of the Will).

2015-07-27T00:15:15,"Finally, a movie that accurately depicts how many Christians imagine their plight, perceive science and reason as persecution, and view the argument against the existence of god as more of an argument against the morality of god. There are plenty of religious folk in academia, in fact, many universities are Christian institutions. As far as philosophy, I don't think many would argue that you can prove or disprove god, and outside of philosophy, you're not going to deal with the subject of belief except in theological studies.   The whole, ""angry at god"" atheist is a figment of Christian propaganda. It's an imagined enemy to help make Christians feel righteous in their hatred. Atheists aren't angry at god. We done believe in him. Yes, there are many of us that find the monotheistic religions to be very poor guides to morality, but that is not the grounds on which we base our disbelief. We don't believe, because we find the evidence to appear man-made and unconvincing or non-existent.  Still, most atheists would be more than happy to fight for your right to believe whatever you like. It's state sponsored religious promotion and the denial and perversion of proven science that we are against, and so too should believers. Secularism is for the benefit of everyone, because guess what? If Islam, Mormonism, Scientology, or any other religion becomes hugely popular in the U.S., and we do endorse state sponsored religious displays, your kids will be praying the Qur'an towards Mecca at school, or instead of a nativity scene on public grounds, it might be a statue to L. Ron Hubbard or Joseph Smith.  The colonies learned really early on that meddling in the affairs of religious beliefs and supernatural was nothing but trouble, and ended in the murder (and accidental deaths in jail) of many people during the Salem witch trials. So let's all agree to believe what we want to believe, not step on each other's toes, leave religion out of the official public sphere, and all sides stop making the others out to look like the aggressors, because that would be a propagandistic simplification.",2,1,groomedtodie,Mqf5gAYcFWs,0.09765873015873015,2015-07-27 00:15:15,False,False

I don't think I have ever seen someone who is non-budhist or non - Hindu put a negative comment on a Hindu or Buddhist film because that would be considered blasfime! and it is blasfime! but it's alright to do it to Christian films because they are an ""easy target"" ? of course it's not right! if any one of you people actually watched the film the main character was asked is he forcing people to become christian and he says no they have a choice whether they want to be or not THERE SEE!  you have a choice! the main plot of the story was to do with a professor wanting a pupil to admit that God was dead and the pupil refused and other stories are brought up in the movie! so let bigons be bigons let us have our christian films/tv shows/ books ect.
