2017-05-12T11:43:48,"This movie is THE SHITTIEST SHIT ever made. Reasons: 1) Makes white people seem all mighty stupid, reason? Because they don't ""know that black people are also people"" seriously, every all black cast always has something degrading a white cast member as if they don't know shit about humans with different pigmentation. 2) remake of bad moms. This is seriously just like bad moms but black cast and extremely horrific.  3)They literally protested black people as how black people say ""they are not"" what I mean by that is there is of course a black stereotype as there is a white stereotype(just mentioning the white stereotype for all you snowflakes out there) the black stereotype is extremely ghetto, ""sharquisha hold my earrings"", ""BIIIATTCHHH IF YOU DONT"". Need I explain more? And all for hay for the sake of humor which there is non of. 4) this movie such as bad moms has already been made a hundred times. Let's be real  5) The women in this film have advocated for ""feminism"" yet they portray themselves the way they do not wish females are looked upon as? I have no problem with all that shot but they are the people who say ""women are stronger and just as good as a man"" and so forth. Yet they act of course for money putting all beliefs aside by saying ""all hang my tit out for you so I won't have to pay""lmao feminism ,the girl swinging on the freaking balcony hanging out her vagina and there are many other examples I am sure.

I'm subscribed to Tiffany's Youtube channel. I didn't know who she was until I saw Girls Trip previews. I'm glad black movie director Malcolm Lee put her in Girls Trip so I could know about Tiffany. She was definitely the star of the movie. I love Regina Hall, Jada Pinkett, Larenz Tate and Queen Latifah too. Queen Latifah's hair when she was at the airport was terrible LOL. I wanna have sex with Regina too. Regina is hot. Jada and Larenz played in 2 other movies called Menace II Society and The Inkwell. Menace II Society is a classic but The Inkwell sucked LOL. I wouldn't be surprised if there's a Girls Trip 2. I heard Girls Trip made a lot of money. Tiffany made me laugh when she was sucking on a grapefruit and a banana when she was explaining to Queen Latifah and Jada how you suck a black man's dick LOL. Tiffany is too funny LOL. Tiffany and Jada made me laugh when they were pissing a lot on people below them when they were hanging in the air on a long black rope hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha. I like the sexy black dress Jada had on when she was pissing on people. Her hair looked good too. I see she had a young black man as her boyfriend. He had 2 grapefruits stuck on his dick when Jada was trying to give him head in her hotel room. He came running outta the room naked with 2 grapefruits on his dick LOL.

The girl version of this movie will have a lot of over muscular half naked men, sex toys and over explicit sexual content and language. Female movies have a stronger tendency to go over the top with the sexuality. Actually that's majority of the movie but it's an overflow. Extra sexual language, sex toys, male strippers, the whole shebang lol they go all out sexual for women movies lol the man version will have club scenes, some strippers, and a couple of prostitutes but it would all be portrayed in a somewhat more subtle or humorous manor. It wouldn't be as vulgar as the womens version. The R in ""Rated-R"" wouldn't be as hard in the mans version as it is in the womens version. That's why men dont agree with movies about a girls night out together. To a degree, especially if all the people are of the same human race, they represent they're race of people.
