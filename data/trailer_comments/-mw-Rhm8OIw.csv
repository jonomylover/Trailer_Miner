Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil,  neither also is it in them to do good.6 Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O LORD; thou art great, and thy name is great in might.7 Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee.8 But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a doctrine of vanities.",2,0,Yarad Yisrayl,-mw-Rhm8OIw,0.32,2016-06-16 10:32:05,True,True

2016-06-17T16:20:25,"That actress that is holding that shot gun thinks that common folk not suppose to speak to her. We met her before and she was so smug and needs to come off her high horse especially since she still plays these kind of roles in an effort to pay bills. Gabrielle Union is just the fakest. Monique is just being Monique, but at least she keeps it real. Omar Epps is adorable as always. I will just be glad when they decide to produce a movie depicting us as the rulers and Pharaoh's that we once were and have the potential to be again. They kiss the ring and always come with this kind of product. Most Nubians are waking up. We not playing this fake jews game no more because it is UTTER IGNORANCE. Only simple church folk [NEGROS] will go watch it; because masses are waking up and simple humor is no longer amusing. Racist jews in Hollywood will refuse to listen and produce something real because they father nothing but lies and tricks. I sincerely doubt that these actors and actresses are just this dumb and simple acting in real life. Especially the stuck up one holding the gun. they know that this is dumb mind programming. Nubian families have regained the memories of who they are and we are tired when these actors and actresses of Black and brown skin constantly portray us as idiots and foolish people. I can understand them wanting to live comfortable; but to sell out in the process is just ""Cheap,"" as compared to where we actually came from along rivers and palaces. Nowadays the water front properties are just cheap and so is the characters that live there. If Nubian cinema is like this, I do not support it . The jews in Hollywood have to put this mess out worldwide, because as long a the Nubian and true Israelite is stupid then they won't demand the arms, comfort, money, and land that the false ones are getting. Moreover, as long as they can use these cheap ones to portray us like this and show this to the rest of the world then this is how foreign lands will perceive us to be. they are the lowest of the low in representation. I would refuse to be cheap like this; and have refused it. We went from having our own systems of government and economy to being slaves and stuck up actresses holding rifles on cheating husbands that invites a thot to a dinner during a white mans holiday; supposedly secretly being held on the birthday of Horus. It has really gotten pathetic. Danny Glover knows the truth and so do the others; but they rather pay these bills to these trolls. I went to Montserrat for a fundraiser for his movie about the Haitian revolt back in the 90's. ! What Happened ! I can't stand Trolls. Hollywood is full of Trolls.
