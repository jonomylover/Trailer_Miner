If you want to advocate for equality, why would you try doing so by putting men down? You are essentially saying that you do not think women can raise to the standard that society holds men to, so you take them down. That is outlandish. Build women up instead of taking men down and generally representing them as sexist. If you want to diversify the cast, then why is it that you have not brought any attention to any new actors that would help diversify Hollywood? That is also outlandish if your goal is to advocate for equality. Why are you remaking a movie that was originally created by a man? If you want to bring attention to female directors, it makes no sense to steal the ideas that male directors had and just swap the genders of characters in the film. I guess all of those questions are pointless. This is a money-grab. I wish that the money invested in this movie would go towards actual aspiring female directors considering the absence of women in that field. You could have used that money to create scholarships for female film students to get through college. You could have given that money to a female graduate to produce a film. This kind of capitalization is generally unappreciated. The toast joke was alright. That is really all there is to say though.

2018-08-15T05:23:56,"I see everyone is upset that this is a remake from the movie ""What Women Want"" and they think this movie will make no money. Let me break this down, there's no problem with recreating a movie. I personally see no issue with them switching the characters, but other people do. I wouldn't say the goal of this is to empower women, because the original movie wasn't made to empower men. It seems to me that when there is a movie with a female as the lead, people often say the movie is meant to empower women. That is not the case. Doesn't it seem a little strange that when you see a movie with a man as the lead, people just see it as comedy and something entertaining, but when you see a movie with a women as the lead, people just say it's about feminism, and to empower women.This makes me upset.

2018-08-15T12:35:17,"(The Holy Spirit explained in the book of John):  ***The Holy spirit is the third person of the Godhead who exercise the power of the Father and the Son in creation and redemption. Because the Holy Spirit is the power by which believers come to Christ and see with new eyes of faith, He is closer to us than we are to ourselves. Like the eyes of the body through which we see physical things, He is seldom in focus to be seen directly because He is the one through whom all else is seen in a new light. This explains why the relationship of the Father and the Son is more prominent in the Gospels, because it is through the eyes of the Holy Spirit that the Father-Son relationship is viewed.  ***The Holy Spirit appears in the Gospel of John as the power by which Christians are brought to faith and helped to understand their walk with God: He brings a person to new birth: ""That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit"" (John 3:6); ""It is the Spirit who gives life"" (John 6:63); The Holy Spirit is the Paraclete, or Helper, whom Jesus promised to the disciples after His ascension. The Trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are unified in ministering to believers (John 14:16)<---And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever. (John 14:26)<---But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you). It is through the Helper that Father and Son abide with the disciples (John 15:26)<---But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me.  ***This unified ministry of the Godhead is also seen as the Spirit brings the world under conviction of sin, righteousness, and judgment. He guides believers in to all truth with what he hears from the Father and the Son. (John 15:26). It is a remarkable fact that each person of the Trinity serves the others as all defer to one another. The Son says what he hears from the Father (John 12:49-50). The Father witnesses to and glorifies the Son (John 8:16-18 & 50, 54); The Father and Son honor the Holy Spirit by commissioning him to speak in their name. The Holy Spirit honors the Father and Son by helping the community of believers.  ***Like Father and Son, the Holy Spirit is at the disposal of the other persons of the Godhead, and all three are one in graciously being at the disposal of the redeemed family of believers. The Holy Spirit's attitude and ministry are marked by generosity; His chief function is to illumine Jesus teaching, to glorify his person, and to work in the life of the individual believer and the church.  ***(Romans 8:9)<---But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man (have not) (the Spirit of Christ), he is (none of his).  ***(Acts 5:32)<---And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that (obey him).  ***(Hebrews 1:9)<---Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the (oil) of (gladness) above thy fellows.  ***(Are you a WISE or FOOLISH VIRGIN???):  ***(Matthew 25:3-4)<---They that were (foolish) took their lamps, and took (no oil) with them: But the (wise) took (oil in their vessels) with their lamps.  ***(Ephesians 4:30)<---And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.  ***(The Holy Spirit of God): Should never be pushed away, ignored, or rejected, If we would remember that the one who lives in us is God's own spirit, we would be much more selective about what we think, read, watch, say, and do. Note that Paul acknowledges that (evil thoughts) and (actions) are (temptations) even for those who are (sealed) by the (Holy Spirit).",0,0,mlzanercik,HeoLiTirRp4,0.1873376623376623,2018-08-15 12:35:17,True,True

This also made me realize that a lot of these movies are remakes of older movies that had male protagonists. I‚Äôm very against this, not that I‚Äôm scared all my male protagonists will be womanified and I won‚Äôt be able to relate with the characters, far from it, but actually I read a comment talking about how the 13th Doctor was a woman. (Sorry if spoilers but it happened last year c‚Äômon) she said that it‚Äôs only hurting not only feminism but women in general when we take these stories that are already awesome and just replace the men with women, because it makes it seem that women can only be awesome, if they do it in a way that people know because men made it awesome, basically trying to becoming amazing in the shadow of past males. What we should be doing is telling original stories with female characters doing original and new and funny things (if you want funny in your movie) that way women don‚Äôt need to climb a mountain that was already set by a man, but rather climb her own mountain. That being said all we‚Äôve seen about this movie is the trailer (and the whole story of the movie) so who knows maybe this will be different, from what I can tell they actually got the writer from the old movie to do this one, so maybe it‚Äôll be good or better than the last movie.",0,0,Algernon,HeoLiTirRp4,0.19834498834498837,2018-08-15 23:56:04,True,True

2018-08-16T02:58:04,"Somehow, to me this movie seemed sexist to both genders.   While it is meant to make us think the main character is discriminated based on their gender, they are unlikable by the halfway point. While I can't speak entirely, since the movie isnt out yet, the ""protagonist"" seems like someone who is stuck up and believes they deserve everything and more. Can't speak for the other characters, as we haven't seen any yet.  Now, as for the males, they got it a WHOLE lot worse. The trailer either portrays them as obnoxious, disgusting, dumb, or sexual. The only male character in the trailer that is portayed in a good light is the employee guy, who even then has some stereotypes put onto him.   Now, before you rage at me, I know it is a comedy, and I actually did enjoy some of the jokes shown in the trailer. I may watch the movie and change my opinions after more trailers are released. This is my opinion, and if you dont believe what I said, I respect that.

Sure, he runs into a few crazies and a devious person or two, but the moral of the story was that women overall were worthy of his respect and kindness... So why is it that I get the feeling that this version won't reciprocate that sentiment very much, if at all?

This idea was already definitively and sweetly done (no I don't mean the Mel Gibson movie from 2000) by my man Rod Serling in The Twilight Zone in (I'm guessing) around 1960.  Remember that episode where this meek and mild bank clerk of a guy (can‚Äôt recall the actor‚Äôs name but it was Darren from ‚ÄúBewitched‚Äù)....kind of a 1960 version of an unsocial nerd......throws a quarter into the coinbox of a newsstand while buying¬† a newspaper, and the coin lands in a way that it balances on its edge by itself?  And after that he can read everyone‚Äôs thoughts.....and it turns out it‚Äôs not that much of a gift.....and it starts to cause him alot of problems....except for the one lonely yet sweet and pretty secretary who works with him, who when he hears her thoughts finds out what a wonderful person she truly is inside....and that she actually likes him.  And it gives him the moral support he needs.¬† In the end, he stands up for himself, improves his job situation, gets the girl, and humbly learns a little something about life AND his fellow man and woman.  Oh, the last scene is as he‚Äôs walking past the same newsstand later that afternoon, he throws another quarter in for the paper‚Äôs evening edition and his quarters KNOCKS DOWN his quarter still standing on edge from that morning.¬† After that he can no longer read thoughts.¬† But the eight hours was all he needed to acquire a newfound wisdom, and he moves on with his life as the better man for it.¬† The last scene is him and her walking down the street arm-in-arm, on to their new life.  As with most of Twilight Zone episodes, it‚Äôs sweet, poignant, and with a strong moral lesson to the story.¬† ¬†This subject (of suddenly acquiring the power to read thoughts) has already been done to its ultimate by him 55 years ago, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs gonna be improved upon....least of all by this stupid piece of throw-away trash (that I suspect will NOT do well at the box office).¬† I hope the entertainment industry just lets it rest after this......it‚Äôll never be done any better than the genius Rod Serling did it 55 years ago.",1,0,Ken Dee,HeoLiTirRp4,0.08473800505050504,2018-08-16 22:52:40,True,True

2018-08-17T09:33:53,"I'm a white male and when I was 17 this black girl tried to ""turn up"" with all her friends while in class. They stopped the entire class to play loud music on their Obama phones and dance on the tables. The teacher couldn't do anything because she was pretty scared after the black kids screamed in her face for asking them all to sit down and stop misbehaving. They were shooting some kind of worldstar hip-hop video showing how the black kids run the school or whatever. Anyway this black girl decided to end the little music video with her pouring her drink into my bookbag (she was dancing with a 7/11 BIG GULP grape slushi). I never said much in class or had any friends, so I think my irrational thinking at the time was justified. I stalked her and her ""peoples"" after school, waiting for her to break off from the group and walk home by herself. When she finally did, I made sure no one was around, I was scared as fuck, but still super upset about what she had done. I krept up behind her and slammed my fist so hard into the back of her head that she went into a SEIZURE! She was drooling and everything. First I started running away, and then I came back because i was mad scared that I may have accidentally caught my first body. After she stopped shaking, she started making noises like a lama or camel or something, so I ran as fast and as hard as I could trying to find someone. When I did, I told them that a girl was having a seizure and that she needed help. I pointed to where she was at and kept looking over my shoulder as I speed walked away hoping no one would know what really happened. Anyway she came to school the next day in crutches. Turns out she thought she had a stroke and had this placebo effect to where she THOUGHT she couldn't move some parts of her body and needed crutches. That's not even the funny part, the funny part is when she tried explaining to everyone who would ask how she had a ""brain aneurysm"" which triggered the stroke and that the aneurysm caused a ""lump"" near the highest functioning part of her brain, (which was actually the swelling from my punch). On a more serious note, black people enjoy doing shit like this, torment so many kids their age, people like me, and then turn around and cry that society makes them out to be bad people.  I compare black people to honey bees and bumblebees, they all look the same, but we can't always tell which are the ones that live only to sting you.",0,1,bubba bojanglez,HeoLiTirRp4,0.018554994388327736,2018-08-17 09:33:53,True,True

The people behind this movie are entirely aware of the controversy this will cause, and this is, in fact, the primary reason the film was made   In any case, both explanations baffle and irritate me. This movie is trash, and no one should be subject to it. To point out the blatantly obvious, imagine this movie was made not about men, but women. One can only presume this movie was created by women, so imagine this movie was made about women, by men. It simply wouldn‚Äôt get made, but because Hollywood is interested only in money, it will happily create such drivel whilst jumping on the virtue signal bandwagon.

2018-08-20T01:41:34,"So 'what women want' was a critique on how women are more complex then what a chauvinistic man could know and it portrayed many different facets of women but it was careful in their portrayal to not only try and be accurate but also not to dig to hard at women. It has been a while but I believe that there was one or two mean women in that movie and that was it.... This on the other hand, I see no redeeming qualities in any of the men shown, and while it could 180 and end up doing the same thing as the first movie this trailer gives the impression that ""men bad, women good"" which should not be what they should strive for as there are many men who are more complex then hormones and potty humor; however, women make up a large portion of movie goers and they could just be using it as a reaffirmation of what women believe men to be like in order to turn a quick buck.   This is going to be the ghostbusters remake again with over the top theatrics to drive a point that has none. In this trailer alone there was potty humor, dabbing, a nut shot and the realization of a character ability from so little context that if that scene actually does what they just showed then someone should be fired. Remember when mel gibson had to convince the psychiatrist that he could hear her thoughts? Yea me neither, he had to have walked in and said ""you should not think that of me"" and she told him he was a mind reader then no one laughed because that is not how any good story is written.",93,3,gildarmesh,HeoLiTirRp4,0.12923809523809524,2018-08-20 01:41:34,True,True

2018-08-20T02:42:13,"For anybody not aware, this movie is a parallel to the original What Women Want starring Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt.   Gibson's character was portrayed in the trailer uncaring, competitive, and entitled, who felt slighted by the decisions of upper management because the position he was due was given to some new girl, and upon receiving The Gift (through arguably terrifying/traumatizing means - he got drunk and accidentally electrocuted himself in a bathtub), decided to exploit everyone around him with it. What was not portrayed in the trailer but revealed in the full release was his self-actualization, and coming to grips with the fact that there were more important things than his career, that being a better person was more admirable than a promotion.   That's the formula this movie is going to follow. Taraji has basically already said as much. In this trailer, her character is portrayed as uncaring, competitive, entitled; the position she feels she is due is given to some new guy. She receives The Gift (through potentially terrifying/traumatizing means - she is drugged by a stranger and then goes  to a rave and at some point is knocked unconscious) and subsequently decides she is going to exploit those around her with it.  What I imagine won't be portrayed in trailers, but will be present in the final release, is the journey of self discovery and the cycle of empathy and guilt over the wrongs she's committed, just as it was in the original.   TL;DR: I get the kneejerk reaction to sensationalized content, but keep in mind that the trailer is intending to show the Wildest Of The Wild to get you to respond. To get you to be interested enough to click. If you don't like the premise, that's fine, you don't have to go see it. But try to look into the full context before you make assumptions or decisions about what the narrative is actually trying to present.",0,1,Disaster Jones,HeoLiTirRp4,0.13757014590347924,2018-08-20 02:42:13,True,True

2019-01-23T22:57:19,"Depends on how old a man is what he wants.   When I turned 29, my priorities changed from soul searching while trying pathetically to get laid to where sex didn't matter where sex and arousal was replaced by personal interest as a substitute for lust and shared common traits as a substitute for getting off.   As I age though, it keeps changing. I turn 35 this year and it alread feels like I am going through changes. When I was 13 through 20, my raging hormones never shut up, but my moral compass had me soul searching instead of listening to my ego. From 21 through 28, my main focus was to hopefully get laid and meet my soul mate through my lays through after sex attitudes and her related hobbies. I never met her unfortunately and all the women I ever was with just wanted to use me for sex and they had no personalities outside sex which those times made my cry after they left for work before returning after work for more sex. It is funny though for the rumors of women not being interested in sex, they certainly enjoy it more than men do on average even when you are too fatigued to which is when they want it more than ever. I digress.  So now that I am 34 going on 35 this year, my priorities are changing again from common interests, hobbies, romance, and pretty much meeting a weirdo woman who is smart, nice, caring, loving, sharing, loves old school action movies, is a tomboy, is a gamergirl, loves anime, is spiritually in love with and is in sinc with nature, can be very aggressive, is strait up down to earth, is independent from the state, single with no kids yet, but just waiting for a nice strait up down to earth asshole with his own personality who is inventive, creative, very nature loving spiritual, doesn't look at jewelry in value of money, but in a spiritual symbolic meaning instead, isn't lured in by greed, but thinks you make enough to get by instead where rent, bills, and food come first before having fun money for life's perqs, of course he knows she comes first over their potential kids they may have naturally, is a gamerboy, loves anime, and is in sinc with nature spiritually in sinc like yours truly.  The change of course is going from that to focusing only on myself which I cannot help it. Seems like my state of mind is changing from soul searching to embettering myself to the point where I do not care if I find my soulmate or not as if this change is turning me into a person who thinks of ""soulmate"" as allagory like the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus where it feels as if I can do better without a woman if that makes sense to you.   So getting right to it, based on myself, I will state the age gap states of minds of men and what they want by age reference.   6-12, a kiss goes a long way to make his day by his crush. He wants to be kissed by his crush and he wants to get the latest videogames for his next birthday or for Christmas.   13-20, I want her, her, her, and her over there. What they want is get laid while playing the latest newest videogame by hopefully playing the videogame while having sex with their crush and high school sweetheart. All the other women are distractions from what he really wants as he wants his first time with his crush to be perfectly magical. He really doesn't want them, he wants her and his favorite videogame.   21-28, maybe I will meet her if I put myself out there and maybe having really great sex will lead my to misses right through trial and error. This is the period men are at their worst as pictured in your movie as they figure soul searching is best found by getting booty and the after sex personality of women dictates if she is the one by how she acts after sex. Of course this is also the time where men either commit suicide the most or they become players who play women's games. They want to find their soul mates through sexual intercourse.   29-34, my partying days are over, I just want to find someone who shares common traits with me. They want a woman by her common shared values and personality traits before sex crosses into the equasion.   35-?, seems like my life is more important than soul searching, if it happens, it happens, but I am not worried about it because I got my whole life ahead of me. Seems after 35, all men want is to feel good, look good, be successful, get more involved in family, be healthy, work out, be drama free, and avoid women with baggage and issues as seeing women by their sex appeal seems childish, but at the same time, your standards are pretty damn high as you see women as friend's you rather keep as friend's as you put women in separate categories of friend's, best friends, acquaintances, potential lovers if you wanted to but you constantly change your mind about it almost like the reverse of puberty, and friends with benefits although your desires to get off are dead only you do it to relieve stress instead.",0,0,SpadeGhostVampire7777,HeoLiTirRp4,0.21405379188712517,2019-01-23 22:57:19,True,True

2019-02-23T17:19:15,"*To anyone feeling like this is only another feminist movie that turns out to be sexist towards men*  I don't think this movie was meant for every man to feel like shit, it's just about a woman who felt sabotaged in her own field of work, sports, which is a field usually considered as ""manly"" I think we can all agree on that. It doesn't have to mean that it's the truth everywhere in the world or in every ""manly"" field, but for the good advancement of the plot maybe men HAD to all be assholes here. (Or maybe it was inspired by a place of work that was actually inequal in many ways, who knows?) I'll explain myself : the real-life stories that inspire action-comedies such as this one are combined together in order to make what is a sensitive topic, here sexism but it could be racism or homophobia aswell, more shocking and therefore create more action ! Because the aim of such a movie isn't to show dramatically how women suffer in their place of work, with long scenes showing the pain and struggle of the main character in her environment. The aim is to make it funny and here, to make a women look badass ! So I think that when a topic as this one is exploited in a comedy, everything is made to look more dramatic and can then hurt men because it doesn't really take time to explore the characters' feelings. Even the woman here, I haven't seen the movie but you'll probably see her cry once and then she'll be fueled on anger for the rest of the film, that's how it goes ! So what I'm saying is that you shouldn't expect for a comedy to show you what equality is, and yes, it is a possibility that the director just missed the point of feminism, but it shouln't matter because this movie genre was never meant to show a real-life situation with real-life feelings, but only the environment's emphasised shortcomings in order to create action and make the main character evolve !",0,0,Klasc T√∏p,HeoLiTirRp4,0.055666666666666656,2019-02-23 17:19:15,False,True

2019-08-16T04:56:19,"I see a lot of comments about how the movie demonizes men and is ""feminazi"" propaganda with an agenda. And it's right. The movie has an agenda: to show that men and women want the same things. Love. Respect. Understanding.  At first, while her white straight male co-worker played by Max Greenfield in the film appears to be an egotistical dumb ""boy"", his character is really very quiet and subtle. Ali, played by Taraji P. Henson, learns that he is a caring and team working man who kept supporting her until the very end, learning to be a team worker like him in the end. Fatherhood is shown as this beautiful thing in the film.  Her father, played by Richard Roundtree, is a very touching character who did inculcated his daughter with a fierce sense of competition, but who ultimately only wishes the best for her and is always listening.  She learns trust and compassion from her future boyfriend, played by Aldis Hodge, who is never demonized by either the film nor the characters, being a sane model of manhood and fatherhood. And Jamal, the young and passionate new basketball sensation (played by Shane Paul McGhie) is damn well played and is the thematic center point of the story. He learns to follow whaf is in his heart and not in his mind which Ali teaches him by the end through a pep talk, but she learns this lesson FROM Aldis Hodge's character, her future boyfriend. Even her assistant, played by Josh Brener, is who is her shown as being her foil in the movie, manages to score some good jokes and well thought character development. The contrast of his insecure and quiet nature with her bombastic attitude is even more highlighted when she humbles herself to let him show his talent and self confidence, acknowledging his work and qualities.  Although a couple of men are antagonists in the movie, they are shown as toxic and opportunistic people (mainly her boss, rival and the cheating husbands of her friends), highlighting the theme of cooperation and team work of the movie even more.  The jokes qre crude and can be over the top sometimes, but the emotional and romantic comedy parts did the movie justice.  3.5/5 overall  It gained its place on my shelf alongside thrthe original, What Women Want (which still is a goddamn classic hard to beat though).",1,0,ShakuMascarade,HeoLiTirRp4,0.12843187514240145,2019-08-16 04:56:19,False,False

2019-11-16T14:33:45,"What Women Want: legitimate message about how a self-perceived ladies' man develops introspection and sensitivity towards women by finally listening to them, learning to connect with them personally and professionally, and realising machismo is a transparent and unnecessary insecurity. Women aren't portrayed as catty, backstabbing, conniving, or superficial, but empowered, hard-working, sensitive individuals. Some women feel pressured, isolated and ignored by society to the point of suicide, and acknowledging them as real sensitive people is basic human solidarity. Written, produced and directed by women, portraying both flawed men and women as equals who can learn from each other by dropping stereotypes and communicating. Subtitle of the movie: 'He has the power to hear everything women are thinking. Finally... a man is listening.'   What Men Want: if men aren't sleazy, lecherous, flatulating fratboys, they're emasculated sexless nerds, in another woke Hollywood remake where prejudicial man-haters dilute the work of other female writers for their own vendetta. Filled with tired racial cliches and predictable testicle-crushing slapstick, this shallow world is painted as another big boy's club, where men at every level of society breathe patriarchal oppression through constant humiliation and objectification of women. In an era of soaring male isolation, disillusionment and suicide, pretending men in 2019 are adulterous 1950's caricatures is a more lucrative convenience. Telepathy isn't used to see men as flawed, struggling humans (save for enhancing female sexual prowess in a tokenistic nod to the original), but to confirm them as dictatorial robotic simpletons whose nasty urges and infidelities must be preempted and exposed to protect other women. Subtitle of the movie: 'She can hear men's thoughts. Let the games begin.'
