In fact, you  can not have a king AND queen serving simultaneously as the British sovereign.  The title of King or Queen, is simply a gender identification of the sovereign, and there can only be ONE sovereign. The sovereign, if a king, may appoint a queen consort, but can not be referred to as queen. During this supposed time period the sovereign was George V, who was married to Mary of Teck, his Queen consort. A little surprised a British television company would make this mistake, as local knowledge should know better.

Since acquiring the complete set and movie now I am so happy. It makes me homesick for England and missing certain things and of course that northern accent from some of the actors.
