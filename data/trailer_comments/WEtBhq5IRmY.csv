As a director, producer, composer, and screenwriter, as well as the owner of a big company, you would think that he would shake things up a bit. He could do a Wild West film, for there is a lot material about Black Cowboys. He could do a war film, there is plenty of material on Black Servicemen from different wars. He could do Sci-Fi or a Crime Thriller, both genres he partook in as an actor. Overall, he can do more than this, but chooses not to.

2018-04-01T00:24:44,"Saw it today. Of course,Taraji is fascinating as always. However, the film is, indeed, ""a stereotype of the angry black woman"" as Taraji's character says she hopes you will understand she isn't. Fail! Why the heck would Tyler Perry do this to women? Basically, it's about  a mentally ill person - bipolar, paranoid, depressed, rageaholic - whatever diagnosis you want to fill in for yourself. So in a way there's not true ""back story"" to give her a motive for reacting kray-kray over everything, large and small, that she perceives has been ""done"" to her. She's just another vengeful sicko. It would be a tragedy except that it's so over the top improbable and, consequently, silly. The husband here is not particularly heinous. Yes, he's an impractical dreamer who doesn't have it together financially for many years as he tries to make a Shark Tank breakthrough with his tech idea. And yes, he cheated on her once in their 'teens (for which she forgave him and even followed up by marrying him). But he didn't seem like a major cheating type, he did not abuse her and he professed, always, to love her. For me, he was the scapegoat for all her pent up rage at her intolerant, judgmental family. And that made for a very weak film. Still, Taraji is, after all, HER, and she's going to be a magnet in any movie. Still, I felt let down by Perry, because he seemed to have made a film that depicts a woman as a scorned lunatic. Darn it.

When a woman betrays a man the world couldn't care less. But if a husband cheats on his wife its the end of the world. Relationship has a shelf life because it seems both the husband and the wife has expiration date.

2018-10-06T19:59:24,"People do crazy things when they are pissed off and for Melinda she dug deeper and deeper into a huge hole and she wanted   revenge on Robert and his new wife Diane, He was living in a RV Van and he made bad choices and she had to pay for it and then when Robert struck gold by getting 800,00 dollars from M, Prescott and he thanked Diane for it and that explains why she ruined her wedding dress with acid  I can relate to what Melina and her mother died and she  was close to her mother. Her sisters were always in her business. That pissed her off. The courts hold her to see a shrink and attend anger management classes and was  telling the court that she deserved half of what Robert had. This was a revenge story about hate love and murder. This was a  twisted and dark story. The actress Taraji P Henson did a great job playing an angry woman and I mean you can blame her?  This is why I don't have a relationship with anyone. People piss me off anyways. They do nothing for me so why would I want to kill them. I can't stand people anyways. They suck especially in Northern VA! Let someone else kill these people!
