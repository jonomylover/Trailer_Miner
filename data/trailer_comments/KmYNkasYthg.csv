Mockingjay Part I was actually my favorite because it showed the huge amount of angst and distress the revolution had put in those children; because they are children. It's incredible to see how much they gave grow in a couple of years, only because they were forced to. Also, I think the movie doesn't focus in ""romance"" as much the book does. Katniss talks a lot about Peeta and her confuse feelings for him, the movie only does a fair amount of scenes dedicated to it. Finally, why Katniss chose to fight against Snow? Because of the people she loved and cared about, not because of the explosions and fights and the revolution itself. Katniss wanted to live her life as normal as possible, but always protecting the ones she loved.

2015-06-11T09:40:49,"Katniss and her rebellion launch an attack on Snow's mansion. During the attack, some of the fighters are injured and the medics rush in (including Primm) who are all subsequently bombed, killing Primm. After the battle is won, Snow talks to Katniss and explains that even though his own citizens were attacking him, he would never have bombed Primm or the other medics out of respect for his citizens. In addition, he also explains that had he had one of the gilders which were carrying the bombs which killed the medics, he would have fled and left them alone. This leads Katniss to realise that it was Coin who caused Primm's death. Some time later, the leaders of the rebellion gather to deicde whether or not to hold one last Hunger Games using the children of the former leaders. This last Hunger Games is approved, but never goes ahead. Katniss is then granted the right to execute Snow, but, knowing that it was Coin that killed Primm, and knowing that Coin would become even worse than Snow ever was, chooses to instead assassinate Snow before her despotic regime can take root. In the subsequent rioting, Snow dies, either through being trampled or choking to death on his own blood from his previous injuries. Katniss is locked up and put on trial, but found not guilty by reason of insanity caused by grief over the loss of her sister, and is instead sent home to District 13, where her and Peeta end up together and having children. Katniss now tells others of her trials during the Hunger Games, to make sure a future society never stages them again,  Spoiler alert.",0,0,Felix Lovestar,KmYNkasYthg,0.018107769423558896,2015-06-11 09:40:49,True,True

She seems to be a fan of the lowest brow pop culture calling the Kardashians one of her guilty pleasures, meeting that worthless slag Kim K. and telling her she loves the show and also being excited to meet Taylor Swift? Ugh, why doesn't she just rip my chest open and tear my heart in half! She seemed so smart and grounded as opposed to most of these little Disney tramps when she used to talk about Hollywood awhile back but now she's seems typical and pandering! I still enjoy her performances a lot and am looking forward to this movie but lately Shailene Woodely seems to be taking more daring choices with her career with films like Fault in Our Stars and Greg Araki's White Bird in a Blizzard and after reading an article from New York magazine, appears to not buy into all the Hollywood hype!

2015-06-27T12:30:54,"JUST finished the books like a second ago. I practically ate them in three days. The first one was indulging. The second one was probably the best. But the third... I don't know. It's very depressing throughout all of it, ALL of it. *MANY SPOILERS* Katniss doesn't catch a break. It could be exactly what the author wanted, to make the reader feel the constant and endless anxiety and pain of those in the war. But the epilogue part was too short. If she eventually decided to make Katniss and Peeta end up together, she should have added more scenes/dialogues to show us that love triumphs it all. I know, it might have been a bit corny but that would have healed some of the emotional wounds. I couldn't believe Katniss' mother didn't come to take care of her at the end. After all she's been through... What kind of mother thinks of herself when her child is broken? Heymich was still a miserable drunk, Joana got addicted to morphine, Finnick was killed, Prim burnt to death. At least I feel like the movie will be somewhat better. Maybe it won't focus so much on Peeta being so mentally broken, that was just overwhelming. One thing I am excited to see is the twisted turn the story takes with President Coin. So far we see the rebels as the ""right"" side and the Capital as the ""evil"". But we will see that history tends to repeat itself, and that there are no right sides in a war.

2015-07-05T18:39:22,"*I WARN YOU SPOILERS OF MOCKINGJAY PART 2 - READ IN BOOK*  Everything you hoped for, demolished. 1:03 Peeta is hijacked but he only gets insane because of the memories in the games, most of the time he is fine. Can't say the same for Prim (Ill get to prim soon). Coin wants Katniss dead to produce more sparks in the rebellion. Katniss does not die. A successful attempt was made breaching the Capitol, but the Capitol have defenses. Finnick dies protecting Katniss. So does the rest of the team helping her to get to Snow. (Not getting into the team names.).  The children in the capitol was surrounding Snow's mansion. They were all massacred by double exploding bombs that you get from parachutes in the actual 75th hunger games. The bombs only exploded once. Prim was in the front lines on helping civillians at the time the bombs only exploded once. But then the bombs exploded the second time. Prim is a human torch, eventually she dies with the rest of the children.  You'll probably think that Katniss is alright...No, well yes. But she is severely damaged but her face (the best feature) is untouched by the blaze. She is back in District 13, she is damaged but shocked of her sister's death questioning it. She meets up with Snow in his cell 1:18 (which is his greenhouse) and said he didn't order the massacre. He was going to surrender because children in the capitol was precious for him. He had a granddaughter he cared for. This had Katniss lead to extreme paranoia. The rebells put Prim in the situation and intentionally called in the brutal attack.   Execution day. Katniss is ready, dressed up to go 0:56 she is walking toward Snow all chained up. She points her arrow on him. Then she turned and shot Coin in the balcony. Simply she killed Prim, ordered the massacre and tried to kill Katniss. Snow dies anyway when he was laughing, he choked to death or the civillians beat him to death. Katniss is apprehended and taken to a room. She had made an attempt of suicide but failed. She was stuck there for days but she is free to roam around the room freely. She was finally taken to a hovercraft. She was pardoned for killing Coin because she was the Mockingjay - the face of the rebellion. Plutarch and Beetee was send of to one of the districts. Gale was sent of to District 2 because he had some fancy TV job, later on he found another pair of lips to kiss and Katniss was sent of the district 12 to live her life in the Victors village.  Later on Peeta and Greasy Sae joined Katniss. Peeta was pretty damaged like Katniss because of the bombing. Greasy Sae was a friend who helped Katniss withh dishes and food. One night, Buttercup (Prim's cat) some how found himself finding his home. Hissing at Katniss. Katniss cried and threw all her rage at Buttercup because Prim was dead. The cat realized that Prim was gone for good. Buttercup became a new friend for Katniss. They would comfort each other and cry together. Katniss mother was still at the other district helping the needy so she was all alone with Buttercup, Greasy Sae and Peeta. Katniss still went hunting.  One night, Peeta came around to Katniss and confessed his love for her ""Real or not Real do you love me?"" and she said ""Real""  Years later. They had children, happily married and the Hunger games were no more.   *Sidenote* When Finnick said ""Welcome to the 76th Hunger games"" it was a joke because there were so many traps.",0,0,YouCannotDenyGlaDOS,KmYNkasYthg,0.08623737373737374,2015-07-05 18:39:22,True,True
