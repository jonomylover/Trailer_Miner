Also, I'm really curious to see how they justify being sad. From the looks of the trailer, it seems that Joy is sort of the ""big dog"" in Riley's emotions and Sadness just wants to feel as important and special. When she touched one of the core memories, I can't help but think that maybe it was originally a sad memory, but then Joy made it a happy one, so that when Sadness touched it again, it took on it's true form. (Something like that, I don't know).    Really, Sadness is the only emotion that's sort of hard to defend. Joy is obvious because happiness is positive energy. Fear stops you from doing foolish things (i.e. you don't run out into traffic because the thought of being hit by a car is a scary thought. Common sense, I know, but it's linked to fear).  Anger, when controlled, can actually be a confidence boost and make you want to stand up for what you believe in. Like being angry against a bully. Disgust...well, I guess disgust can be like fear where it stops you from doing stupid stuff and can lead you to wiser choices. But Sadness can be tricky. I mean, no one LIKES being sad, unless it's a stress relief to cry. Anyone care to comment? (Not trying to star a flame war. I'm just curious to see what people say.) ",2,0,Bitsy83,seMwpP0yeu4,0.07125777867965367,2015-03-22 02:15:35,True,True

2015-04-15T00:05:34,"Okay, so I'm excited for this movie. I think it's definitely very emotional and deep if you're open minded and can interpret things on a deeper level. So Sadness seems to be the main emotion that nobody really likes, although Joy tries to be friendly. So when Joy and Sadness get lost, Riley mostly feels Anger, Fear and Disgust. In my mind, I think this shows that when people are so down they try to block out a certain emotion, such as joy, love, sadness, etc., these emotions almost kinda get lost deep inside you, causing your other emotions to take over instead. For instance, if you're broken hearted and you block out the emotion of love, then when another situation comes up where somebody likes you, then you're angry because you don't want to get feelings, or you're fearful because you think they'll leave or you're confused of why they even bother to acknowledge you. So blocking out one emotion enhances your others to take over. All of them together can balance each other out. You need them all. I think that's what this movie is meant to portray on a deeper level.",0,0,SweetSorrow,seMwpP0yeu4,0.0894383394383395,2015-04-15 00:05:34,True,True

Based on my experience humans have a detached thought body.  So we unconsiously see thought forms or shadow bodies. But if you see a doctor and tell them that you see shadow forms they tell you that you are delusional. Then they try to fill you full of drugs from the pharmacutical industry. When humans die they end up in this detached spirit body or thought form. This world is messed up.

I think this cartoon is not just an ordinary kids movie, rather, more suitable for grown-ups, especially those who struggling with their own crowded minds. I read somewhere, some psychiatric even try to connect the message from this movie with Autism and Depression. Tough subject for kids cartoon, right?   There's one cute character named Bing-Bong, he not even mentioned in the trailer, yet his part is so grandiose & touching. Prepare yourself, Bing-Bong gonna put a big painful lump in your chest & lung while you watch (or can't even).   There's so many sad moments in this movie, too sad for kids, yet, I think, it will relieving for the adults. Since we don't have many chance to cry nowadays... Nevertheless, the sad parts is equal with the funny & happy parts. There's many smart dialogue & plot that you can't even point out. Who knows a mind of 11-year old girl named Riley could be that astonishing heartbreaking...?   I love Joy so much, and her joy in this movie isn't the ignorant one. She try to be happy all the time for the sake of Riley. So when Joy became sad at the centre of the movie, you really need to grab lots of tissues, FAST.   Whoever you are, you should watch Inside Out: Highly recommended, it's funny, shocking, happy, sad, smart & even terrifying in some pivotal parts. 10/10 for Pixar. Love it!!

Anybody out there identify a lot with the subject matter in this movie? Like just about everything?  Kind of sucks when you go with a group of people to the movies and they don't get the same thing you get out of it so you can't really engage in deep conversation about it with anyone besides the funny and sad parts. It's as if people in general will get some sort of buzzkill talking about heavy subjects, like its taboo. Like we just want to keep it superficial. Not often can a movie get you reflecting on your life while bringing out a multitude of emotions that are actually depicted as animated characters.

I made a lot of nice friends and had a lot of fun.I made almost all of my good memories there. Instead of hockey, I've developed an eager passion for soccer. I've played peewee soccer for about a year, and it was pretty fun to meet new people on the soccer team. We lived there for about 12 years, until we took an unexpected turn and moved to Korea. At first, I was excited, but i was also sad for having to lose my friends that i've known for a lifetime. I tried to keep positive, but things took a serious downhill overtime. As soon as school started, I was all alone. The people there were mean and racists. Soon, I starting to get depressed, lonely, and even had some suicidal thoughts. One time, I couldnt take it anymore and spent about a month on getting plane tickets and escaping to Canada. But i knew i couldnt do it, so i just decided to stay in Korea. Is been 3 years now, and I've lost my passion for soccer, lost all self confidence, and have depression, anxiety, social issues, and lonliness. I'm 15 now, and have lasted 3 years in hell.

For example: Joy doesn't feel joyful always, like when she was on the memory dump, she was not joyful, she was sad. When Bing Bong dies, every time an island falls, she wasn't joyful. And also, when she and Sadness were in the subcontanious, she was afraid. Also sadness. And if you take a little look to the movie, the emotions not always are like they are supossed to be. So like the emotions are not always acting like their names, that means that they have anothers type of feelings.

2019-01-12T00:04:45,"On some level, Inside Out does a somewhat admirable job at trying to explain to children (and I guess, easily impressed adult children) how emotions work... sort of. It tries to explain that our emotions control our mental faculties, that we think BECAUSE of our emotions.   This line of thinking is far too naive.   What old Pixar was really good at doing, is telling a story that had both a simplicity that made children understand and a maturity which reflects the reality of the world. It was exceedingly clever and charming and it taught children on how the real world works. Inside Out however, is too fictitious to be taken seriously, and not fictitious enough to be taken lightly.   First off, to think that our thoughts and minds and behaviors are controlled by emotions is just patently wrong. Feelings are not reality. Humans are not a manifestation of feelings, the environment is not built upon emotions. Emotions are a symptom of how our minds process our environment.   We are happy when something good happens to us, we get angry when we are transgressed, we are sad when we lost something of value to us, we are disgusted by things that would harm us, we are afraid of things that we don't understand. Emotions are reactions, not actions.   So right off the bat, the premise of the film is already off. Things are not made any better with the plot. The film centers around Joy, (an emotion of 12 year old girl Riley) having forced to confront a life-altering change and going through a coming of age journey, learning things about Riley, about Joy itself and of other emotions Anger, Disgust, Fear and specifically Sadness  This journey is something that Riley should go through herself, by learning to deal with overwhelming emotions, rather than represented by proxy through Joy. Instead, the movie shows Riley simply ""feel"" things that are happening to her, rather than understand what's going on and take responsibility and accountability for her own wellbeing - which is the essence of growing up. By the end of the movie, Riley herself didn't learn anything, she didn't have any growth.",0,0,Unicorn Bunny,seMwpP0yeu4,0.12557720057720054,2019-01-12 00:04:45,False,False
