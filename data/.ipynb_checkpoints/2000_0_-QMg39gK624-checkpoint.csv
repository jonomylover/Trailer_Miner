The problem is that i don't  know how to get this generated codes into my Android studio to as to enable my app make the data calls. i'll be very happy, if you can help me with this explanation. thanks.",0,0,Samuel Akporedafe

2019-08-27T19:52:00Z,"Disclaimer: I come from an analytics and data science background I have been playing around with YT API for a while but I can't wrap my head around them. It seems to me, but please tell me that I am wrong, that there is no way to access the detailed data that are necessary to do some proper data science. What I would like to have is a flat file, csv, excel, text, whatever that contains: 1 ROW per each VIEW in the ow, there must be ALL the data available for the view (video, duration, date, time, playback location, source, demographic, geography, browser, OS, etc. etc. etc.) I don't mind filtering the data, I would be perfectly happy to download a few terabytes of data every month or so. This information must exist because it is exposed in aggregated form in the YT analytics, but it seems that it is not accessible in any way. It is really frustrating, for a data scientist, to have to cope with aggregated data that do not offer any real insight. I can tell if a video or a group of videos are doing well but not why!
