2020-05-23T09:43:46Z,"I like how they used the train as the basis for Joker's development. 
It's reminiscent of ''The Killing Joke'' monologue when Joker was talking to Gordon:


''Memory’s so treacherous. One moment you’re lost in a carnival of delights, with poignant childhood aromas, the flashing neon of puberty, all that sentimental candy-floss ...

The next, it leads you somewhere you don’t want to go...

...somewhere dark and cold, filled with the damp, ambiguous shapes of things you’d hoped were forgotten..

Memories can be vile, repulsive little brutes. Like children, I suppose. HAHA.

But can we live without them? Memories are what our reason is based upon. If we cannot face them, we deny reason itself!

Although why not? We aren’t contractually tied down to rationality!

There is no sanity clause!

So when you find yourself locked onto an unpleasant train of thought, heading for the places in your past where the screaming is unbearable, remember there’s always madness!

Madness is the emergency exit...

You can just step outside, and close the door on all those dreadful things that happened. You can lock them away... FOREVER.''",1,0,Cristian Duta

2020-05-19T01:55:36Z,"What i always love about the stair dance scene is that in other movies a character would usually constantly being shown going down the stairs symbolizing their descent into madness if you will. But here it's the opposite Arthur is shown mainly going up those stairs until now and instead of him feeling sad while he's walking down the stairs he's dancing gleefully without a care in the world and he embraced his descent down the stairs aka his descent into madness. Or maybe it could symbolize a descent into hell and becoming a monster, who knows film is subjective in the long run and i thought this movie was a breath of fresh air for film in a year full of mainly blockbusters and cash grabs and the films that were amazing got shunned by audiences and box office but this didn't even with it's ""controversie"" (and i'm using that term lightly) which honestly makes me proud cause it just goes to show film as an art form will last for a long time and people will now hopefully give a lot of art house films a watch.

Get off the bandwagon sheeple and see it for what it really is, just another ripoff of one of those '70's movies' where the protagonist is a useless, impotent little schmuck who gets screwed by the world and finally 'has enough' then goes completely psycho. It's basically Death Wish, Taxi Driver and others with some Fight Club and American Psycho thrown in i.e. was it all in his head or just some of it? Who cares anyway. The protagonist is utterly detestable and is only 'likable' because everyone else in this fictional world is made to be even worse. He's surrounded by asshole strawman characters who exist only to prop him up and make his 'descent into madness' and psychosis something audiences should empathize with. WELL I DIDN'T. He's a raving psycho and a lunatic and HE'S NOT THE JOKER. Why? The Joker has a sense of humor, no matter how twisted it may be. This guy is just Joachim Phoenix being his usual weirdo self for 2 hours, also that crap he said about letting everyone out of the jails, please. Take away his Oscar and lock this nutcase up for society's own good. This film should be called 'Psycho Clown' or 'Killer Clown' anything but JOKER, it's an insult to a GREAT CHARACTER.",0,1,Michael Ray

Right after he mailed the acid bomb to Bjork he filmed himself painting his face and facing around and he had this creepy smile on his face. He was like a child on Christmas. Just like the Stalker, Joker planned to kill himself and that though was such a relief that it was exciting. Maybe even arousing. The only difference is that the Stalker actually blew his brains out (with a .38 caliber revolver) and the joker blew away the man who hurt him so badly. I wonder how much Todd Phillips borrowed from the Stalkers personality to create the Joker? In both I see that same essence of sad and quiet desperation and that glee tinged madness reminiscent of a near demonic entity buried deep down in the human psyche.

Or maybe he does know he’s spiraling and sees it as a good thing contrary to how we see it🤔. Either way it’s a great film imo.",5,0,L.2.L

2020-04-21T15:59:50Z,"guys stopped immediately with your comments because I have something to say you know one thing two months ago they were disappointed and sad that Endgame, while remaining as the first major collection in the history of cinema, was unable to bring home any Oscar and this is a  negative record to all Marvel fans this really sad.But it seems that someone today needs to listen to another truth this is the academy (Oscar), I have always stepped aside I tried to be confident before the release in theaters whether  Infinity War and Endgame the two most anticipated films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that Black Panther and since one revealed the news that the academy has decided to target the Black Panther film instead of Avengers: Infiinity War and during the night of the Oscars Avengers: Infinity  War came out without any statuette won through First Man's fault The man on the moon for the Best special effects and as for Black Panther he won three statuettes thanks to the cor policy  ent on culture and despite being disappointed there is still the hope that the last Avengers Avengers: Endgame movie could win at least one statuette after the release in the cinemas and I would have been confident and happy that at least for once in a while it would win and nominate  at least three 4 nominations but instead The academy has ignored only punished serious films such as The Joker, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and 1917 and then nominate it only a nomination for the best special effects disappointing many fans for the nomiantion in the next edition at  Oscar 2020 and then being defeated / lost / snobbed again for the best special effects since 1917. But now enough is enough because doing so has not brought me anywhere.  You know what I knew that The Academy before the nominations would have liked to name it Avengers Endgame as the final chapter of the Marvel Studios cinematic universe of Phase 3 for the best special effects, best film and even as the best supporting actor but instead not because the  the academy has decided to choose The Joker the film directed by Todd Philps because it is so different and serious compared to the cinecomics compared to the films on Marvel Studios this is unfair and not so true nonono.But the only thing that acacduta from now  ij these years and years that nobody cared about Marvel movies is The academy that has had so much attention and more power and more authority and more space to dramatic and serious films and even to the film that has had more nomiantion The Joker  and Black Panther who won three statuettes thanks to the involvement of the academy thanks to the corent policy in which there are black colored actors.  And trust me when I tell you that Marvel fans didn't want this, it's every year and years that pass we have to surprise and endure when the academy only nominates a nomination for Marvel Studios films instead of nominating one for the best special effects.  And every year that has haunted when the films about Marvel Studios in which throughout this film (such as Captain American The Winter soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy) there are no black actors, they are always named one makes me feel bad.  I feel like going out and breaking on this stupid figurine and breaking on the table when I get angry, and every year after year that the Academy awards the Oscar for films for the best special effects Jungle Book, Life for Pie, The First Man  and 1917 and an insult is a slap in the face of every single film that would not deserve such an Oscar.  The academy is an ignorant asshole and its voters didn't give a damn about the cinecomics because they did in 2018 and then ignores these voters that nobody does not shit on the film with the highest grossing in history in the Avengers Endgame cinemas.  Every week and week there are always news already seen on the Avengers Endgame movie in which he did not bring home a figurine because they ignored Logan The Wolverine and Wonder Woman as happened to the other films. Anyone behind all this including me also thought the academy can  kiss your ass.  Because Black Panther winning the oscars thanks to the corent policy does not belong to him I would not reclassify Avengers Endgame as best film / Great movie but there are at least many cinecomics that the Oscars would deserve  to win the Oscars or X Men days of the future past, Captain American, Guardians of the Galaxy Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 Thor Ragnarok Captain American Civil War Doctor Strange and Avengers: Infiinity War.",0,0,Captain Mario

Here he embraces the Joker and not until the last minutes of the movie we see him truly unleashed.

2020-04-06T21:34:09Z,"The end of the afternoon nears. There´s no one in the elevator at this time. Outside the sun has begun to set. There´s maybe still an hour of light left. The never ending stairs that were so tortuous to walk up are surprinsingly fun to walk down. The rhythm in my veins beats again and I dance my way down those stairs. I feel light as a feather, like I have wings. I jump over the puddles, there are sparks springing from the soles of my shoes and grey pigeons fly off around me as I pass. I laugh. I truly laugh, like I´ve never laughed in my whole life. This is what freedom feels like.
Then suddenly I spot two men at the top of the stairs. Oh no, it´s those detectives.
- Hey, Arthur! We need to talk!
I start running. So do they. I run through the streets of Gotham City, dodging people and jumping over the garbage bags scattered across every sidewalk. I quickly turn around to see them. I´m one block ahead. I´m almost at the subway station. I cross the last avenue when something strikes me. All I know is that my feet are lifted from the ground, the world is turned upside down and my sight is blurred for a moment. I realize I´ve been hit by a taxi. My body hits the windshield and I fall on the asphalt. I´m disorientated but I hear the detectives yelling close to me, I pick myself up and after quickly checking that the gun is still in my pocket I start running again towards the station. I run up three stairs at a time and manage to squeeze myself into the train just as the doors are closing. I catch my breath and notice that the train is full of clowns. They´re all wearing masks and some carry signs. Ah, that´s right. Randall mentioned a protest. Oh no! I thought I had gotten rid of them but I see the detectives entering another wagon. I push my way to the back and cross into another wagon. I´m lucky to go unnoticed amongst this multitude of clowns. It´s hard for them to spot me. But my makeup is different. I need a mask. I take the mask from one of the clowns standing next to me.
- HEY!
The man pushes me, I dodge him and he ends up beating another guy. A fight starts from which I manage to escape but the detectives get involved in. The subway is a mess and when the doors open at the next stop, the clowns push out the officers and beat them down. Hahahaha. This is fun. For once I´m on the other end of the blade. It´s not me on the ground getting kicked. I take off the mask and throw it into a dumpster. I don´t need it anymore. I light a smoke and cross the last tunnel that separates me from the studio. Police officers run in the opposite direction, towards the chaos where you can hear screams and a single gun shot. I continue my way.",0,0,Iron Warrior

2020-03-26T10:31:33Z,There is a very huge difference between Oscar Winning Roles. There are the ones that win because of minimal talent and amazing writing and directing. And those who win because of sheer talent alone. However there is that role that comes by every now and then that is both and those are the characters that will be iconic forever. Look at Russel Crowe in Gladiator or Some otter roles( can’t think of any but there are surely more) but what I’m saying is this is a 2/10 Oscar winner for the decade... rarely do you have both the amazing performance along with the amazing writing.,25,0,Jacks Broken Heart

If you rewatch this movie with this point of view - This movie feels fcuking satisfying.
But in real society instead of being Joker , You need to be like Batman who doesn't just give up like Arthur , but works to solve this problem . It is hard to digest , but yes......Joker is wrong . This is why the movie is about the FALL of Joker , not the RISE of Joker.",0,0,Pegasus Films

It's real, there is still a  "" Stigma"" .Joker  Spirals downward to a place where he can Survive.  Too many grave disappointments.  Lost a Job that he loved Etc...mostly took care of his mother too. Until the end when he discovered the Medical records of his mother and himself.  Father too. I'm only speculating,  but it seemed to me that he strongly believes that his mother didn't try to protect him. Many factors played into this movie.  He was beyond returning to the frame of mind he began. Which was a fragile  point.  There is a lot to said  about the  Human Mind.  I'm not excusing his behavior     however   I can Understand why.  FANTASTIC  ACTOR. Joachim  Phoenix.  He deserved the  Oscar for Best Actor.  I can only hope that people may become more Compassionate for the downtrodden   in our Society.

0:01 I love how joker approaches from the side and centers in the camera. blurred image of narrow hallways signifies the undefined pathway/future of joker. Covers the light and becomes darker.
0:18 Love that smirk as the elevator door closes 
0:24 Joker slowly realizes what he is capable of... initially with small body movement then it gets wilder and wilder. All his surrounding is old and seem derelict. But he is new. He is reborn. He is free at last. He is letting go. The burden is reduced as he takes one step at a time. Contrast to climbing up the stairs after work.

2020-02-27T06:18:10Z,"One of my favorite things in this movie was the stairs. There are multiple times he uses the stairs, whether they be these or the ones at work. A couple of times, most notably at the beginning of the movie, he trudged up the stairs. Life is an uphill battle for him as Arthur. Climbing the stairs every day is an arduous task for him, and he’s grown weary of it. But the day after he kills the Wall Street guys, at work, he seems more at ease and happier, a little more outgoing. He skips down the stairs, and writes on the sign. And here, once he becomes Joker, life isn’t a struggle for him anymore, now that he’s embraced the chaos and tragedy of his life and decides to do whatever he wants. He dances down the stairs to the music in his head, unabashed and unashamed.",10,1,JakeM917

That is why for me this is not a work of art and does not represent the joker to the criminal or the enemy of batman. The criminal lunatic clown with whom batman fights. The actor did well but does not represent the joker the script is bad, it could be a good tragedy movie that shows a cruel society.

The colors were also much darker, both from his clothes and the camera and the music was sad. Now at the end we see him, dancing in public, with new colorful clothes on, while dancing wildly and free to happy music. That shows us without speaking a word, how much Arthur likes his new role as Joker and that he now finally understands his purpose in life. You could also say that him walking down the stairs, represents him walking down a dark path, full of blood, but he loves this dark path, since everyone hated him when he tried to go the way up.

2020-02-14T01:57:46Z,"You know what, I think movies about comic books are lame as fuck in general. The only reason the joker is so good is because it can be seen from a totally comic-free perspective. It's not a good comic movie, it's a great movie with a sad story that could be in any quality drama movie. Now, with that said, I wish they make a joker 2 (of course). The problem is, if they continue to ignore the comic background and make another stand alone movie, it will be weird, like, ""why make a joker movie in the 1st place? You can just call it ""sad clown"" and it'll be ok. I mean, even if comic based movies suck, a joker movie is a comic based movie, albeit losesly. So they have to bring a sequel to a batman universe, otherwise it's just not joker. But, what superhero movie can afford being a part of Arthur Fleck's reality? In other words, it wouldn't be a DC universe joker, but a Joker universe DC movie, if that makes any sense. You need to bring batman in, but it needs to be a completely different batman. A raw, real, authentic guy who doesn't dress in a costume and for some reason is called batman, but is not in any way a silly superhero for kids.",0,0,Maximilian Dummnichtswürdigkerl

But in jokers case it was a symbol of failure and depression. The scene stuck out to me, climbing the stairs at night in the rain after a horrible day. And then this scene came, descending the same stairs at daylight feeling better than he ever has before.",491,9,KhataarFelMataar

2020-01-24T09:23:43Z,OMFG some guy in the comments pointed this out and it just blew my mind. This is Arthers descent into hell and go becoming the joker. Buts it's much more intense than that. When he gets in the elevator at the last moment arther smiles himself stating he is content with the coming out come. He dances his way down finally just not giving a fuck and being himself. But then you have the two cops at the top which represent society and authority trying to bring him back up top. Arther being hurt so much at this point is forced to run straight first into hell completing the transformation into joker. The train scene is my favorite. Despite what modern day reviews or commentators say. Joker isnt a guy with a plan. He just does things. rip heath ledger. The train scene shows that so much. Joker just does things lol.

  Limited Government - the minimum amount of government necessary to govern a population.   

They already have control of the synagogues and church places where they teach people that what matters is genetic heritage, a bloodline, rather than beliefs and behaviour.  They teach that who the children of Israel are is a matter of genetic heritage, that God chose a people, and so does not choose persons.  There is no point in attempting to be holy, they say - "" you are either a member of the master race, the chosen people, the herrenvolk, or you are not. "" - That is the religion they and their followers adhere to.  

 Canaan is a person.  Israel is a person.  An Israelite is a descendant of Israel, and a canaanite is a descendant of canaan.  But who is of the Israel of God , is decided by God :  His Chosen are His People.  Did Aaoron adopt a son ?  Or did Moses ?  What is the nature of a Levite ?

2020-01-18T12:53:46Z,"This is an awesome film about self realization and spiritual awakening. Arthur Fleck is a man who is becoming sane in an insane world. The only killing that I do not approve of is when he kills his co worker. That guy was an asshole anyway but not one deserving of that fate. Killing the three degenerates on the Subway was totally righteous. His mother was understandable and probably a mercy for her and Murray Franklin was a talking head, parasitic modern media brainwashing bastard and those should be killed. But his co worker? No. Yet a part of the process of awakening is learning about free will. I think Arthur has found who he is supposed to be!!! And that is so powerful. If people do not like the proliferation of Joker types in our culture then the way forward is to quit supporting greed, vanity, war, extreme materialism etc. For it makes the unloving culture that creates Arthur Flecks!! This character needed love, a friend, guidance. Instead he got indifference, bullying, hate etc. As he said to Murray Franklin, ""ya get what ya fuckin deserve""!!!! Wow!!! So true. Ya got to remember, Arthur does not have a father, a minister, a shaman or a coach to guide him or a loving sibling!!! Sounds like how we get school and mall shooters to me.",0,0,Nathaniel Lionheart

As The Day Before My Freedom From Thus Nightmare Arrived I Opened My Chest. My Soul. The Aura Drifted Asleep as The Acid Crawled into My Heart. It Was Time to Awake From The River of Distortion.

They are permanently damaged.    They just struggle, day by day, putting in their time, trying to get through this thing called ""life"". And, no, they are not a threat to us.   They are just a threat to themselves.   I am an atheist.  And, it blows me away to think that anyone seeing what happens to children, world-wide, could possibly think there is some kind of god who would allow this.   Who would see this happening and ignore it.   You really want to believe in some kind of god who was so pissed off that Adam and Eve disobeyed him, so he ALLOWS the damage done to CHILDREN?

But, this morning, I watched Rami Malek in Bohemian Rhapsody ajnd thought HE did a great job, too.    yes, by all means, let's KEEP having these awards shows;  they let us see actors as themselves.  BUT,  to say that one actor did a better job in a particular film than another actor did in another film, IS pretty silly.   It's comparing apples and oranges. But, yet, we as humans, can't seem to get away from COMPARING.  If someone does a GREAT job, we can't seem to stop ourselves from pointing out those who did a ""not so great"" job.   


But, as humans, I don't think our insistence on ""comparing"" humans will be our downfall.  Our true downfall is our GREED.  But, our insistence on not appreciating ""talent""---because we keep insisting OTHERS are MORE talented--- doesn't help.   Our planet will live on without us.  But, the best thing that can happen to the ANIMALS on our planet is that, before they go extinct because of us humans---WE, humans, go extinct.   Humans are the most DESTRUCTIVE species the planet has ever known. So, if you believe in some kind of god, your god really f#cked up in creating humans.",0,0,arx754

People before see the Joker movie : This will be the best joker ever! paste the adv memes.
Joker movie: first 10 minutes, the life sucks and it's hard. -2hours later  life sucks and the joker is sad and crazy, because life sucks. Final 10 minutes, Deus ex machina moment and you realize you lost 2hours.
People on internet to don't feel like dumb and be part of the flock: Wow this is the best movie and every minute is a master piece.

Sorry but this movie sucks balls, so life is hard? really? that's new! for who? for people that don't have a problem in their life.. Come on! Where is the crazy killing side of the joker, almost 3 kills and like a millennial with a gun. Give me a break, the killing joke is a great story, this is just a drama story with the label joker on it. Can be the story of superman too if you want, and in the end he wake up... omg! it was a dream? dont know! 
If this movie was the best on the planet earth, why you don't buy the DVD, BLURAY and DIGITAL COPY,? Because it's a classic right? You don't buy it because sucks balls, and you knew it but can't say it because people will point you with the finger.

Arthur is not the ""Joker"".

There is also others with painted faces. Two guys at  3:14 and 3:30 behind wall.

Also the guy who the cop shoots has painted face at 3:39

So the original Batman world Joker might be anybody from this movement or the whole movement  is started by him and Arthur just goes along thinking that its based on him because of hes work as a clown.

Yeah, he came up as Arthur, but came down as joker, a nice metaphor for descent into insanity. But also the colors as well helped with this scene.

Regardless of whether he intended for someone to get shot, he needed a distraction to get away from the cops and he made one. And he did it calmly too.

since the thread below has become a full on religious discussion I think I’ll clear up my view on it. Joker isn’t a evil movie. I don’t even think joker himself is truly “evil”  He’s just a guy that’s been push to his limits and breaks. I think the movie sympathize with western (white) man for that very reason. We’re a group that’s said to have all the “benefits” which makes us the most suitable targets to discriminate against; because living in a first world country is synonymous with living in heaven to a lot of people. I as a white man watched joker because I’ve been constantly bullied in my daily life/affairs, and most prominently online for being white, Christian, a westerner. Today’s society is so clogged up that even bringing up subject matter necessary for further discussion on what we are to do is prone to get you called “racist.” A “Nazi” Or a “conspiracy theorist” I think joker was a baby step at showing people that society is not always greater than the individual. It’s society that treats people like trash; stops rational argument and panders and bewailed’s those who are not like themselves. Look below at @google google. And the 12 comments all being directed at him. There’s no reason to call him a fool or to attack his religion your just proving jokers point “society is awful.” Why can’t we just talk? I’ve been called a Nazi dozen of times in my life, and yet it’s always me that has to remind people to show some humility!",267,16,Decayed Knight

People who watch alot of 'film' seem easily hypnotized by cliche and attitude. The character himself is terribly predictable and uninteresting. I guess this is what Hollywood is selling as a deep picture filled with art and meaning. If this is so its sad to see just how shallow pop culture has become, how inane and synthetic and nihilistic.

This is his final joke ""I hope that my death will make more cents than my life"". Eventually it turned out that Murray death made more cents than his life, perhaps this is why Arthur became really amused and really laughed for the first time in his life after he killed him. The Joker has twisted sense of humor.Such a powerful movie. I watched many great ones of all genera,  I had few favorites , untill this one come- this is the best film ever. So sad and realistic.

Marvel always ""gets it right"" but i dont like their movies. they think using comedy will fix the sucky movies. they make it too hollywood and i dont like that. this is just my opinion though. i can see why people like them but theyre too distant from the comics. they make their movies good for the general population but they cant make anything good for actual comic fans. for example, spiderman 1 and 2 with toby maguire, it was much more like the comics than the new ones with tom holland. to tom holland's peter parker, everything is a joke. toby maguires spiderman had the feeling he was actually a super hero who had to sacrafice thing for helping the greater good. newer marvel movies are just there to get money, no interesting story lines. DC also makes bad movies on the regular, like suicide squad, batman v superman, joel shcumacher's batmans, aquaman, etc. but they also have the ability to make really amazing content like the dark knight or joker. my point is newer cbm's are boring and just plain shit.",0,0,Zeffy

After killing several people including his mother, Arthur is now ""free"",  happy, his makeup flawless, slowly descending (literally) down the steps into madness, when suddenly two cops that represent Arthur's conscience show up and say to him, ""Arthur, we need to talk.""  Arthur runs away from his conscience as fast as he can but the cops finally catch up to him. Trapped together in a train full of clowns, the cops (conscience) and the clowns battle it out, which represents the inner turmoil inside Arthur. Finally,  the train stops, the doors open, and Joker walks out victorious, the clowns pummel the cops (Arthur's conscience) while Joker laughs and  mocks it. The final shot is of Joker with a single blue tear running down his face representing the death of Arthur as he walks away leaving him behind.

The joker is an agent of chaos and having people scared in real life....if that’s not joker I don’t know what is. Again I don’t know if I’m makin g myself clear I’m not approving any crimes in real life however I find fascinating how some people freaked out about this movie.
