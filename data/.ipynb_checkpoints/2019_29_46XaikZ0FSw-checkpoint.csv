It kinda felt like a female  Good fellas, yet you really couldnt connect with the charcters like god fellas.  To be honest the acting was pretty unmoving also. The Asian girl, not be mean, but her charcter,  kinda had no emotion, all her scenes were sleepers. It had a few good songs, but it got hell annoying when they replayed Janet's Contol at the end.

2020-03-05T00:23:53Z,"Most men don't care if a woman has a degree, a job, a car, a house, or money in the bank. So, if she thinks these are the things that are going to attract a man, she's throwing all the wrong things on the table.

Men do care about how you look, how do you look naked, will we be able to have reasonable, free, open and willing access to sex with you, or will there be unreasonable conditions and will you use sex as a ""weapon"", will you be a good wife to us and good mother to our children, are you fiscally responsible, will you be faithful to the relationship, are you fun to be around (not a whining, complaining, shrew of a bitch), are you a gold digging entitled parasite that just wants to have access to our resources and nothing more and then drop us like a bad habit when you've drained us dry for some other poor slob that has more money, do you know how to cook a full meal and are you willing to happily do that for us, are you able to efficiently run a household and not feel it beneath you to be a stay at home mom, love your husband, your children, and be happy and content to do so? Are you only getting married so you can get a divorce, take us to ""family court"" and financially rape us of our home, our children and turn them against us, take our money, the ""family car"", and all with the force of the law behind you, have the courts burden us with unreasonable child support, take our retirement savings and then some, our life savings, and any other future income or hope of happiness we may have had left?

Ladies, you have absolutely nothing to lose by getting married to us and everything to gain. You risk nothing, and we risk everything we have, now and in the future. You bring nothing, absolutely nothing to the table except emotional and financial pain. If you aren‚Äôt bringing sex to the table, then why are you even here? I can get everything else I need from both my male and female friends, and a dog. I can cook my own meals and clean my own house and all without complaining about it, which women refuse to do anyway. For those nights I get a little lonely, if need be I can pay for companionship to someone who will at least pretend to like me, and the best part is she leaves when I tell her to and it doesn‚Äôt have to be the same girl next time.

You did this to yourselves ladies, by buying into feminism. A woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle? You can have it all. An exciting career (that really just turns out to be a job you need to support your sorry selfish ass) and be a mother all at the same time and all without a man.

How is that working out for you?

Men have heard you loud and clear and we have left the plantation. Enjoy your exciting, successful career/job, and your cats.

Well then, a man needs a woman like a submarine needs a screen door.

Would you be so anxious to get married if things were reversed and you are the one that could be financially ruined for the rest of your life and have your children ripped away from your arms and then have their little impressionable minds poisoned and turned against you by your formerly loving husband, just because your then husband decided on a whim that he wasn't in love with you anymore, was bored, and wanted a divorce so he could ‚Äúfind himself‚Äù, he needed some ‚Äúalone time‚Äù, some time away from each other to think things through (code for he‚Äôs got another squeeze somewhere on the side)? Takes your house, falsely accuses you of hitting him and sexually assaulting your own children, coaches the children to tell lies about you to the family court system and then gets a restraining order against you so you are out of the house and can only have access to your own children under state supervised visits because you are now considered a husband beater and a pedophile, you are now a registered sex offender (try getting a job with that on your record), if you don‚Äôt pay him every month or if you just call him he‚Äôll file a harassment suite on you and you‚Äôll find your ass in jail, openly moves his new girlfriend into your house while you‚Äôre rotting in jail, and you are no longer allowed in your own home but still paying for....

Why would any intelligent man get married and enter such a one sided legal and binding contract with a woman? It's just a bad deal all the way around for all men and a crap shoot at best. The ‚Äúfamily court‚Äù laws are so biased against men.

If you were thinking of starting a business with a partner. Would you sign a contract with him or her that allowed that person to end the business at any time for any reason and take all the assets, everything you own now, and anything you might earn in the future‚Ä¶. FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE just because he or she wanted to?

Women are always on their very best behavior when you are dating them because they want to legally trap you into marrying them and then ‚Äúhook‚Äù you with a kid. They look at you as a lifetime meal ticket, an amusement park ride with a life insurance policy. Once you marry them everything changes. All of a sudden, the things they liked about you and thought were so cute and sexy.... they no longer like.
The things they used to like doing for you inside and outside of the bedroom.... they now tell you, they never did like doing those things anyway. Well that would have been useful information you might have wanted to share with me BEFORE you married me. How would it work for you if I tell you after we get married? I never did like working, quit my job, planned on living off the state welfare system, moved us all into public housing, stayed home, drank beer, and watched television all day?

Why do you think they are smiling when they walk down the marriage aisle? It‚Äôs because they know they‚Äôve just given their last blow job and sex with you has now all but disappeared. They‚Äôll still be getting their sex, it just won‚Äôt be with you.

They have weaponize sex. They now put conditions on everything you once took for granted and anything you may want now or in the future.
They now try to change the man they married, into the man they wanted to marry.

They start eating like pigs and gain weight, cut their long hair short because it‚Äôs easier to take care of, with no concern of whether you liked it long or not. They stop dressing up like a woman and start dressing like a man, and in general just stop taking care of themselves.

Bottom line for you guys and I can‚Äôt say this strongly enough‚Ä¶. DON‚ÄôT EVER GET MARRIED!

Because the one you used to ‚ÄúF‚Äù will now be ‚ÄúF‚Äôn‚Äù you.
The woman you marry, is not the same woman you divorce.

When you are dating you must always be dating from a position of power. By this I mean that you must be willing to walk from any relationship at any time and she needs to know this can happen. This absolutely must be on the table at all times if you are to have the upper hand.",1,2,im1who84u

It was everything I would expect from a mainstream film..lots of crowd pleasing visuals, crowd pleasing dialogue, recognizable celebrity names, predictable dialogue and an appeal to audiences under 22 or so.  But I'm glad the movie was made as I support the movie theatre industry and if a film at the movie theatre makes money I'm glad....even if the film lacks originality or substance.  If Hustlers had been made as an independent feature they wouldn't have tried to cover so much ground.   I would give the movie a 6 out of 10 with 10 being the highest mark.",7,1,JACK ANTHONY

First of all you have a cast of the United Nations and each person is regulated asgore subjected to stereotypical propensities. Poor Jennifer talentless Lopez is supposed to be the protagonist however she is depicting a  Puerto Rican girl from the Bronx. I am left to ask yet again how is she acting? That's really who she is. Where I am flabbergasted is the up-and-coming actress from crazy rich Asian plays the articulate, business-savvy, and more enlightened character. Since Jennifer Lopez  was quote on quote headlining wouldn't she be the protagonist?  She's an imbecile.  Didn't someone on J-Lo's team or even a rod catch on to this flagrant Canardism .
