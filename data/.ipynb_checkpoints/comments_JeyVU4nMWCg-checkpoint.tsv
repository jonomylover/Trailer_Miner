2020-05-23T09:43:46Z,"I like how they used the train as the basis for Joker's development. 
It's reminiscent of ''The Killing Joke'' monologue when Joker was talking to Gordon:


''Memory’s so treacherous. One moment you’re lost in a carnival of delights, with poignant childhood aromas, the flashing neon of puberty, all that sentimental candy-floss ...

The next, it leads you somewhere you don’t want to go...

...somewhere dark and cold, filled with the damp, ambiguous shapes of things you’d hoped were forgotten..

Memories can be vile, repulsive little brutes. Like children, I suppose. HAHA.

But can we live without them? Memories are what our reason is based upon. If we cannot face them, we deny reason itself!

Although why not? We aren’t contractually tied down to rationality!

There is no sanity clause!

So when you find yourself locked onto an unpleasant train of thought, heading for the places in your past where the screaming is unbearable, remember there’s always madness!

Madness is the emergency exit...

You can just step outside, and close the door on all those dreadful things that happened. You can lock them away... FOREVER.''",1,0,Cristian Duta

2020-05-19T01:55:36Z,"What i always love about the stair dance scene is that in other movies a character would usually constantly being shown going down the stairs symbolizing their descent into madness if you will. But here it's the opposite Arthur is shown mainly going up those stairs until now and instead of him feeling sad while he's walking down the stairs he's dancing gleefully without a care in the world and he embraced his descent down the stairs aka his descent into madness. Or maybe it could symbolize a descent into hell and becoming a monster, who knows film is subjective in the long run and i thought this movie was a breath of fresh air for film in a year full of mainly blockbusters and cash grabs and the films that were amazing got shunned by audiences and box office but this didn't even with it's ""controversie"" (and i'm using that term lightly) which honestly makes me proud cause it just goes to show film as an art form will last for a long time and people will now hopefully give a lot of art house films a watch.

Get off the bandwagon sheeple and see it for what it really is, just another ripoff of one of those '70's movies' where the protagonist is a useless, impotent little schmuck who gets screwed by the world and finally 'has enough' then goes completely psycho. It's basically Death Wish, Taxi Driver and others with some Fight Club and American Psycho thrown in i.e. was it all in his head or just some of it? Who cares anyway. The protagonist is utterly detestable and is only 'likable' because everyone else in this fictional world is made to be even worse. He's surrounded by asshole strawman characters who exist only to prop him up and make his 'descent into madness' and psychosis something audiences should empathize with. WELL I DIDN'T. He's a raving psycho and a lunatic and HE'S NOT THE JOKER. Why? The Joker has a sense of humor, no matter how twisted it may be. This guy is just Joachim Phoenix being his usual weirdo self for 2 hours, also that crap he said about letting everyone out of the jails, please. Take away his Oscar and lock this nutcase up for society's own good. This film should be called 'Psycho Clown' or 'Killer Clown' anything but JOKER, it's an insult to a GREAT CHARACTER.",0,1,Michael Ray

Right after he mailed the acid bomb to Bjork he filmed himself painting his face and facing around and he had this creepy smile on his face. He was like a child on Christmas. Just like the Stalker, Joker planned to kill himself and that though was such a relief that it was exciting. Maybe even arousing. The only difference is that the Stalker actually blew his brains out (with a .38 caliber revolver) and the joker blew away the man who hurt him so badly. I wonder how much Todd Phillips borrowed from the Stalkers personality to create the Joker? In both I see that same essence of sad and quiet desperation and that glee tinged madness reminiscent of a near demonic entity buried deep down in the human psyche.

2020-04-21T15:59:50Z,"guys stopped immediately with your comments because I have something to say you know one thing two months ago they were disappointed and sad that Endgame, while remaining as the first major collection in the history of cinema, was unable to bring home any Oscar and this is a  negative record to all Marvel fans this really sad.But it seems that someone today needs to listen to another truth this is the academy (Oscar), I have always stepped aside I tried to be confident before the release in theaters whether  Infinity War and Endgame the two most anticipated films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that Black Panther and since one revealed the news that the academy has decided to target the Black Panther film instead of Avengers: Infiinity War and during the night of the Oscars Avengers: Infinity  War came out without any statuette won through First Man's fault The man on the moon for the Best special effects and as for Black Panther he won three statuettes thanks to the cor policy  ent on culture and despite being disappointed there is still the hope that the last Avengers Avengers: Endgame movie could win at least one statuette after the release in the cinemas and I would have been confident and happy that at least for once in a while it would win and nominate  at least three 4 nominations but instead The academy has ignored only punished serious films such as The Joker, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and 1917 and then nominate it only a nomination for the best special effects disappointing many fans for the nomiantion in the next edition at  Oscar 2020 and then being defeated / lost / snobbed again for the best special effects since 1917. But now enough is enough because doing so has not brought me anywhere.  You know what I knew that The Academy before the nominations would have liked to name it Avengers Endgame as the final chapter of the Marvel Studios cinematic universe of Phase 3 for the best special effects, best film and even as the best supporting actor but instead not because the  the academy has decided to choose The Joker the film directed by Todd Philps because it is so different and serious compared to the cinecomics compared to the films on Marvel Studios this is unfair and not so true nonono.But the only thing that acacduta from now  ij these years and years that nobody cared about Marvel movies is The academy that has had so much attention and more power and more authority and more space to dramatic and serious films and even to the film that has had more nomiantion The Joker  and Black Panther who won three statuettes thanks to the involvement of the academy thanks to the corent policy in which there are black colored actors.  And trust me when I tell you that Marvel fans didn't want this, it's every year and years that pass we have to surprise and endure when the academy only nominates a nomination for Marvel Studios films instead of nominating one for the best special effects.  And every year that has haunted when the films about Marvel Studios in which throughout this film (such as Captain American The Winter soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy) there are no black actors, they are always named one makes me feel bad.  I feel like going out and breaking on this stupid figurine and breaking on the table when I get angry, and every year after year that the Academy awards the Oscar for films for the best special effects Jungle Book, Life for Pie, The First Man  and 1917 and an insult is a slap in the face of every single film that would not deserve such an Oscar.  The academy is an ignorant asshole and its voters didn't give a damn about the cinecomics because they did in 2018 and then ignores these voters that nobody does not shit on the film with the highest grossing in history in the Avengers Endgame cinemas.  Every week and week there are always news already seen on the Avengers Endgame movie in which he did not bring home a figurine because they ignored Logan The Wolverine and Wonder Woman as happened to the other films. Anyone behind all this including me also thought the academy can  kiss your ass.  Because Black Panther winning the oscars thanks to the corent policy does not belong to him I would not reclassify Avengers Endgame as best film / Great movie but there are at least many cinecomics that the Oscars would deserve  to win the Oscars or X Men days of the future past, Captain American, Guardians of the Galaxy Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 Thor Ragnarok Captain American Civil War Doctor Strange and Avengers: Infiinity War.",0,0,Captain Mario

2020-04-06T21:34:09Z,"The end of the afternoon nears. There´s no one in the elevator at this time. Outside the sun has begun to set. There´s maybe still an hour of light left. The never ending stairs that were so tortuous to walk up are surprinsingly fun to walk down. The rhythm in my veins beats again and I dance my way down those stairs. I feel light as a feather, like I have wings. I jump over the puddles, there are sparks springing from the soles of my shoes and grey pigeons fly off around me as I pass. I laugh. I truly laugh, like I´ve never laughed in my whole life. This is what freedom feels like.
Then suddenly I spot two men at the top of the stairs. Oh no, it´s those detectives.
- Hey, Arthur! We need to talk!
I start running. So do they. I run through the streets of Gotham City, dodging people and jumping over the garbage bags scattered across every sidewalk. I quickly turn around to see them. I´m one block ahead. I´m almost at the subway station. I cross the last avenue when something strikes me. All I know is that my feet are lifted from the ground, the world is turned upside down and my sight is blurred for a moment. I realize I´ve been hit by a taxi. My body hits the windshield and I fall on the asphalt. I´m disorientated but I hear the detectives yelling close to me, I pick myself up and after quickly checking that the gun is still in my pocket I start running again towards the station. I run up three stairs at a time and manage to squeeze myself into the train just as the doors are closing. I catch my breath and notice that the train is full of clowns. They´re all wearing masks and some carry signs. Ah, that´s right. Randall mentioned a protest. Oh no! I thought I had gotten rid of them but I see the detectives entering another wagon. I push my way to the back and cross into another wagon. I´m lucky to go unnoticed amongst this multitude of clowns. It´s hard for them to spot me. But my makeup is different. I need a mask. I take the mask from one of the clowns standing next to me.
- HEY!
The man pushes me, I dodge him and he ends up beating another guy. A fight starts from which I manage to escape but the detectives get involved in. The subway is a mess and when the doors open at the next stop, the clowns push out the officers and beat them down. Hahahaha. This is fun. For once I´m on the other end of the blade. It´s not me on the ground getting kicked. I take off the mask and throw it into a dumpster. I don´t need it anymore. I light a smoke and cross the last tunnel that separates me from the studio. Police officers run in the opposite direction, towards the chaos where you can hear screams and a single gun shot. I continue my way.",0,0,Iron Warrior

He freaks out when he sees the cops because he knows that if they arrest him, then he will probably be locked up for the rest of his life.even when he gets hit by the car he shrugs it off and keeps on running.That’s how much he doesn’t want to live anymore. He only wants one thing, death and going to prison will only further his suffering.",0,0,Joannes Reyes
