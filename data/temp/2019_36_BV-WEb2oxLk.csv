Perhaps a good sequel featuring Will Smith & Tommy Lee Jones might be what Sony needs in order to get the franchise back on track.",17,0,Ben Chipchase

2019-11-15T01:30:46Z,"This movie was another feminist woke disaster. The main male character, played by Chris Hemsworth, is a braggart and stupid. The main female character, played by Tessa Thompson, is a Mary Sue. She shows no character development, she simply is the top candidate, who becomes a trainee, who despite having no knowledge of the inner workings of the MIB instantly becomes a top agent who outperforms the stupid braggart of a male agent. The story was mediocre, at best, and not compelling. There was no chemistry between the duo, unlike between Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. But at least we spent the entire movie repeatedly showing or telling how much of a gullible moron Chris Hemsworth's character was.  Pathetic. They should have just brought Martin Lawrence on and brought back Will Smith and made it ""Bad Boys for Life In Space"".",1,0,Sirisaac Newton

I read all the stuff possible to read, anywhere, be it the sement beneath my feet, the book or dvd/blue ray under my bed. I think I know how it happend too, that I got a superpower. I was 9 and I nearly died. They tried everything to try to save my life and the hurt done to me was so much I wanted to be all other places than being operated on and the many other things they did to try save my life.

And Thor Ragnarok came out 10/ *3* /17, and in 2017 1+7 is 8. And when both Chris & Tessa were 8, it was 1991. 1+9+9+1= 20. Now we take back that 8 and 1 and then we get 2018 which was when Infinity War came out, and so we take the one again because we just love the one and we add it to that and then we get the year *Endgame* came out and then 2019 minus 2 from the twenty is 2017 which is the year Thor Ragnarok came out. So we replace the 201 in 2017 and use 199 from 1991 and then we get 1997 which is the year the *first* Men in Black  came out. Coincidence? *I* *think* *not* .",0,0,Honey Lemon

I hope families are reunited. I hope we get it back, in somewhat like a normal version of the planet has been restored, if there ever was such a thing.  God, what a world. Universe now. If you told me 10 years ago that we weren't alone, let alone you know to this extent... I mean, I wouldn't have been surprised. But come on, you know. That epic forces of darkness and light that have come into play. And for better or worse, that's the reality Morgan's going to find a way to grow up in. So I found a private area to record a little greeting in case of an untimely death on my part. Not that death at any time is ever timely.  This time travel thing that we are going to pull off tomorrow... it's got me scratching my head about the survivability of all this. But then again that's the hero gig.

Here in America our elite branches like the CIA and secret service recruit almost strictly minority women because they are better at combat than men and better at tactical thinking than men. Basically minority women are superior to men is every way and especially white males and also as a country the the precious precious minorities we have are our greatest asset, given evidence by all the innovation and scientific breakthroughs minority women have given us. I love how the movie shows this reality off by showing us ONLY a black woman is smart enough to track down the men in black, just walk right in and demand a job then quip at the management, just like it happens in real life. This for sure is a great movie and not more corporate waste of imagination writing with the intention of pushing far left ideology, this and late term abortions are easily the greatest achievements of mankind so far. I'm also 100% positive the next Isaac Newton is among us and is for sure a black woman, they are all so amazing and perfect in every way with no character flaws at all. It's sad that 50% of the country are conservative(aka 100% for sure actual real Nazis) and refuse to bend the knee and worship minority women as the saviors of the world that they are.",0,0,kbforme

2019-02-01T15:17:05Z,"I don't find it particularly fair that every new version of a classic is criticized just for not being the original (mib, ghostbusters, jurrasic world, star wars, ...). Of course it isn't. Of course there are different actors and different stories. Of course there might be new characters with different skin colors, genders or sexual orientation. Of course there will be mistakes in them. There were mistakes in the originals as well. The originals weren't perfect either, the jokes not always better. We look at these classics through nostalgia glasses that make us overlook what is not so perfect and exaggerate everything that was great about them. Let's give these movies a fair chance. I absolutely love MIB, and I think the trailer looks like this one is going to be fun as well. Let's watch it with an open mind.",3,3,Anna

And also, seeing the original characters in the paintings in this trailer just tells me that this isn't going to be a reboot, but a continuation of the series with new characters and new heroes. And also, I really don't see how having a lead character who is a woman and black is forced diversity or feminism. All I can see is a woman who has discovered the best kept secret in the universe and just wants to prove herself to the MIB. I don't see any forced feminism or diversity, only a woman wanting to prove herself. I seriously believe this movie is going to be good.

So MiB, is top secret gov't org. and maybe they decided to have different branches in other parts of the world, hence as to why we don't see Will or Tommy. MiB International is showcases a London-based team (I saw the London Eye, so I'm presuming they are a London-based team), hence as to why you see Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson. Only one person reprised their role and that was Emma Thompson, I hope Will and Tommy make a cameo, it would make sense and if not, explain their absence in the film. At least Chris and Tessa have great chemistry due to them performing in a different franchise, Marvel's Thor: Ragnarok. No hate please, I am just explaining it from what I see from this trailer and information on its wikia site. <3 Hopefully I explained it very well, much love <3  Edit: there is an easter egg with Tommy and Will, it is the paintings in the trailer.",0,0,Bernice Marie

2019-01-16T19:20:02Z,If I were the writer of this film I would drop the whole comedy and light hearted adventure vibe and go full on horror mystery thriller. I would have the premise be that an agent or agents have been secretly murdered by other agents in MiB and the organization is trying to get to the bottom of an intergalatic whodunnit so they bring in Thompson as an undercover investigator. Hemsworth would be the main suspect. They would go on missions together but there would be that tension of is Hemsworth the traitor? Does he know who Thompson really is? Or is it all a set up? There are so many ways that it could work But instead we get this stale comedy action. Bleh.  Also please stop using super generic hip hop music to make a trailer seem more cool.

With this trailer though, I’m just left kinda bored.  Not that the actors are bad, but I feel the humor isn’t where I’d like it to be.  That was the fun of the other films: over-the-top sci-fi buddy cop comedy, and it was self-aware of this.

After all, I think they 'arc' ended in the last movie so it is logical to give room to 'new' agents.  I am a little confused by the distaste in how there's a woman in the organization, however- did everyone forget what happened in the first movie?

Don't try to hide behind some stupid argument about social justice warriors and the destruction of society as we know it. Society is far from perfect. You can't hide your discrimination behind an unintelligent argument. Discrimination relies on ignorance in the first place.  Anyone who doesn't understand the phrase men as in the term Men of the Earth, or Mankind need to stop angrily tapping away on their computer and go educate themselves. You clearly have access to the internet, use it for something useful.

2019-01-04T00:54:12Z,"This is one of the reasons new movies from new screenwriters have become nearly impossible to make & so much of Hollywood can't find work: Because the Majors are reviving decades old franchises that have already run their course in terms of originality whom they assign ""studio-approved"" writers to. So we get inferior remakes of ""The Omen"", & ""Straw Dogs"" & ""Carrie"" & on and on. The Studios are counting on the fact that if you're under 30, you've still probably not seen most of the decent films that were made in the 70s, 80s & 90s. So now all we have are Sequels & ""Prequels"" and it's why so many movies flat out s-ck! Look, in all fairness most ""Indie"" movies I see are simply dreadful. Made by filmmakers for other filmmakers they try to be sooo original & so ""Edgy"" that they end up being neither.

2018-12-31T18:24:19Z,"People seem to be mad about many things (such as female characters being in the film) in the new Men in Black, wich doesn't make any sense (to me) for a few reasons. First of all, there were already women in the older MIB movies. Second of all, I didn't see many people get mad because of the presence of female characters in (for example) the new Star Wars movies. I don't see why this has to be a big deal. Also, let's talk about Will Smith... Yes, just like many fans, I am a quite disappointed about the fact that this great actor will not be in MIB : INTERNATIONAL. But unfortunately, you can't always get what you want in life. Overall, even if this trailer seemed like crap to you, I'd still give it a shot. Same universe to save, but new characters and ennemies wich I am eager to meet. 😀",0,0,Mr. Bato

2018-12-31T07:54:15Z,"The studio's didn't even give the original a *full decade* to mature like fine wine before releasing this ""money grab"" *post-feminist* non-sense. They're coming out with 'reboots' to movies that did extremely with no creative thought whatsoever.   And, fine, if the trailer had lines that were actually *FUNNY*, it would be worth a shot, but the fact that NONE OF THE SCENES were funny, just corny and cheesy with lazy music (not even an original score - i.e. ""Here comes the men in black"") I hope this movie bombs so you studios learn that your audience are not idiots and you put the time, effort and creativity into your product.   Lastly, the actors lack that 'charm and charisma' that drew you in with the original actors. They may have been able to get away with a poor script, but what made MIB was the chemestry those two brought to the screen that made it special. Here, they found the best looking white guy with NO COMEDIC TIMING who just so happens to be a good character actor and some random black woman to play the role in a movie called MEN in black, not MEN AND WOMEN in black! If you're going to put women as main characters, which I'm all for in the context of a movie, create a new franchise called WOMEN IN BLACK.   This is just virtue signaling, catring to the lowest common denominator. Hollywood. Please, you're shooting yourselves in the foot. You can't FORCE stardom on actors who lack the ""It Factor"" that makes them stars. If you're going to put people in lead roles, that have to have that special quality that makes them STARS who will draw an audience. No way I would have risked a big-budget film casting a no-name black female actress with no previous comedy background to play a lead role.",0,0,Josef Benjamin

However, Hemsworth replaces the young, hip Smith. And, Neeson replaces the old, serious Jones. The female lead is just some feminist SJW propaganda BS that has no place in it. If they wanted to add a strong female role, they could have made her the director of the agency, or even a citizen helping out.

Oh wait... we might offend some people who identify as Attack Helicopters so just call it ""Entities in Black Suits"" to not offend anyone. /s  I want this to bomb because this is the same as the Ghost Busters reboot, Chris Hemsworth will look like a total bumbling idiot, there for female eye candy and the chick will be the great big ""badass"" who saves the day. Mark my words, it will happen. At this point, they will reboot everything a part of nerd culture and ruin it by installing women where they do not belong.  Why not make something completely new where women can be badass and it doesn't disrespect an already established franchise that loved? See I didn't like Atomic Blonde, but I never complained because it's not part of an established franchise. So I really have no problem with it as a film. If you want to make a female powerful, go for it, but don't ruin an established franchise for diversity sake. Make a new one and if it's good people will go and watch it. Is it perhaps because you know a movie like that won't do so well, so you tag women into lead roles for already established franchises to get butts in seats? Yes, yes I think it is.",0,0,VOLTEC

A strong female character is NOT perfect and untouchable, but should have just barely enough strength (with or without help, depending on what kind of story you're telling) to come through a struggle alive while making it believable that failure is a hair's breath away.

They are referred as 'men in black' due to the fact that in most reported incidents, these agents were men dressed in black. Sony then took the name and made a funny parody based of it. There is no forcing female leads into there ffs. Stop trying to politicise everything. Just cuz there's 'men' in the name dosent mean it's only reserved for men.

They deal with intergalactic/multi-planetary issues, it's just normal MIB has many cells spreaded all over the world.  The idea of making a following up of MIB missions with other agents around the world (in this iteration, London) seems greats to me. About how they look, my only complain is they seem to try to make the main couple to look ""cooler"" by at some point removing their ties... Which... I like them better with their ties on (just a little detail tbh).  From my point of view this ""could"" be a ""good"" movie while the plot and phase of it remain ok.  I don't see the necesity of bringing back WS or TLJ to the film as some sort of protagonists, they already have 3 movies and that's just nostalgia to me in this situation; although a cameo or some sort of ""mention"" would be cool, I still don't think it is a ""necesity"" or the movie will be bad without them.

2018-12-25T12:54:29Z,"Eh, it might not be too bad--I mean, there are Men in Black other than J, K and Z... some of them are women.  Let's be honest, it does seem weird that an organisation can only do anything if two of its members are doing stuff.  Maybe this can remove a bit of the ""J is the chosen one"" type magic that makes the three other movies and the cartoon series somewhat irritating to deal with? If it can reduce the ""J is the chosen one""--than I am fine with this one.  Also... this movie will be deleting all old copies of Men in Black. After it has been in theatre for a month, you will find all your old DVDs, VHS, Bluray, etc. are now this version of the movie--and only you will know of the previous one. Everybody else having no clue it ever happen. Just a bit of a reminder that the older version will cease to exist upon this one being released.  Still... cannot shake the whole ""Straight to home video Disney sequel"" vibe I am getting. I mean... some of those movies are not bad--and some are fun to watch (the vend diagram of that is fun too!)... so, I mean... I cannot expect it to be the first Men in Black if I watch it... but...",0,0,Katrina Payne

2018-12-25T09:13:02Z,"The third MIB is largely argued a flop of sorts. It just wasn't good compared with one and two, while obviously one was by far and large, the very best of the franchise. The reason why it began to be less and less entertaining and less well-received was the fact that they lacked much content overall the further they attempted to extend the series. This also feels too out of place, not for the lack of Will, which is something that goes without saying is weird to say the least, but, it's the fact that they're using two actors which are heavily synonymous with other major movie franchises and characters. They type-casted themselves into specific roles and franchises. Thus, that make this feel really rigid and out of place. But, I hope it will surprise and be great.",0,0,TheCriminalViolin

2018-12-25T08:51:17Z,The shiny guns and the cars are nice.  And I guess Liam Neeson is a good replacement for Tommy Lee Jones.  Chris Hemsworth is OK as a replacement for Will Smith (though it'd still be better with Will Smith).  Emma Thompson generally compliments everything she's in.  But the real stars are the various crazy aliens.  I do hope we see more of them.,0,0,Eric da' MAJ

So I really don’t understand the argument that there are men and women in this reboot or continuation or whatever it’s supposed to be.  Also, they do pay homage to the original as there are posters in the preview with Will Smith and Tommy Lee.  I don’t have great confidence it will be a good movie, but the very first movie already showed there were woman in MIB....",11,2,star0334

Zoe Saldana would have been perfect for this role! Danai Gurira or even Sonequa Martin-Green are better choices for this role. Not only that But Agent M?

The writers wrote themselves into a corner with that film and it showed with rather poor acting compared to one and two.

2018-12-23T07:11:01Z,So let me get this straight? You guys are ripping off on Thor as a way to remake MIB? You could have at least put some effort in and got Chris to develop a different voice. Plus was that hammer scene really necessary? All anyone is going to be thinking about now by watching this trailer is Thor. I smell a green lantern result film. Oh and the other big thing is that if you were going to nod to the gender neutral equality bull crap then you should have at least removed the MEN from MEN IN BLACK. If anyone goes to see this movie it’s just cause we’re going to see the characters from Thor and we want to see how Neason ties into it.,0,0,Mathew Remlin

Some movies are big enough to make a second film riding on the first ones coat tails but come on the FUCKING TRILOGY was 10 to 15 years ago. There must be thousands of brain dead employees in LA that just smoke bud a say that was a good movie let's make another one. And lets put the characters story and center it around  FUCKING Afghanistan or Peru that will bring in the money. RIGHT. I'm in Oregon were assisted suicide is legal.

She is great at everything and never fails. She teams up with Thor and they do a mission littered with terrible comedy. A threat to the world comes at the end. Thor is about to defeat the threat but the girl comes up with an even better idea and defeats the threat herself. The end. This movie will be gutter trash.,0,0,Cynicalsuzy

It totally messes up the rookie-mentor relationship that made the original Men In Black movies fun to watch. I get the immediate impression this movie will be crammed full of heavy-fisted 'female empowerment' messaging, which is so cliché. Women have been cast as lead in action movies since Ripley in the 1970's. If I had to watch this movie I think I'd feel bored with a sour aftertaste of wokeness in my mouth...

That's definitely a subversion, but everything else is the same. The structure of this movie the same as the first and second; two agents who are at odds with each other get paired up, weapons are shown, the trick with the car going into hyperdrive, they fight the big bad, and then there's a twist at the end.

2018-12-22T06:19:43Z,“MIB” you’re kind of epically fucking up right now you realize that right? So... you’ve got literally the leader of one side of the aisle and a highly influential member of the other in the U.K. publicly saying the U.K. gov is failing and can’t function even minimally... this only after several years of robust highly public data indicating this...  Then you have the US which has just failed to even write itself a check when it literally has the ability to print money. This is after quantifiable points of data indicated similar if not worse extreme non performance and outright failure. All of this has now gotten to the extent that leadership from both parties and even the mainstream media are saying basically the US gov is getting an F in line with years of robust data.  Where y’all at? Did somebody not pay your contract too?  I’ve literally got a confessed terrorist police chief getting cops and milint killed which is only a small part of a LONG list of blatantly documented/confessed crimes similarly by an organization that has a stated objective of causing WIII.  Got some work for you slightly more significant than some bs Kung fu 1 v 1 fist fight if you can actually do your supposed job and I have a few skills the market says are worth some money...

(Unlike the new Ghostbusters and it's trailer) I feel like people should not be so quick to strike things down, unless they're given obvious reasons for why we should be wary of it. Now before someone decides to be that guy and say, ""You are apart of the problem!"" or ""They are trying to cash in on my nostalgia!"" First off, I'm a fan of MiB. I grew up with the movies and they are movies I go back to quite a lot. I'm not blindly supporting this, but I am also not quick to just strike it down before it even got a chance to get to the starting line.  As for the ""nostalgia"" argument. Wouldn't it be MORE ""cashing in on our nostalgia"" if they DID bring back Will Smith and such for a fourth movie? Or hell, had him in this trailer more than he actually appears in the movie? (Last Jedi anyone?) Here's the thing, am I interested in this movie? Not sure yet, but I'm not turned off by it either. Could it be fun? Could it be good? Who knows, we'll have to see. The most I will say is what I always say to people when a new product and otherwise is announced.  Wait for it to come out, then judge it for yourself.

The 1 liners & jokes weren't funny at all, and the Aliens looked very sloppy, non-alien like, and like they were very cheaply thrown together by a shitty CGI Artist. Liam Neeson was a good choice to play the head honcho, but Chris Hemsworth & Tessa Thompson were horrible choices to play the 2 agents. This has 'Money-Grab' written all over it. The Producers obviously didn't take this very seriously. They just rushed everything, and didn't take any time or thought about who they were hiring, and if they were right for the job or not. If they were smart, they would have continued the series with Will Smith & Tommy Lee Jones, and gotten Ed Solomon (who wrote the 1st MIB) to write it. Would have been a great idea, because the 1st MIB has always been the best film in the series, and Ed Solomon hasn't written the script for any MIB movies, since the 1st one.",0,0,Evan Martin

2018-12-21T18:17:02Z,"I do not have high hopes for this movie for a few reasons. Whenever I see a trailer for an upcoming movie which proves to be disappointing, there are always a few warning signs, and this one has plenty: 1) Painfully forced pop music. Whenever a trailer has a track of modern music, especially in an adaptation which has nothing to do with it; the studio, marketing, editing, audio department or whoever else is responsible comes off as stupidly tone deaf (e.g. the out of place rap in Assassin's Creed, a franchise whose theme music tends to be subtle and thematic to the setting). Especially when the theme for the earlier movie was already perfect. They even play it here and it sounds far superior to the crap later. 2) Forced humour (movies nowadays appear to be AFRAID of being serious. Yes, MiB isn't a high end spy drama, but the humour is cringe inducing rather than funny). Especially since it reminds me of Thor: Ragnarok rather than MiB when the director is no Taeka Waititi.  3) Bandwagon actor casting (when an actor or actress appears in a good or at least popular movie related to popular culture, EVERYONE seems to want them to give some credibility to the next money grab). This looks more like an alternate universe's interpretation of a boring Thor:Ragnarok. 4) Unfinished effects. Just look at the Justice League. If the effects are incomplete in the trailer, or are updated BETWEEN them, don't expect a well polished product. (Also, expect some unwanted updates as well, such as switching the blue sky to an ugly red) 5) Re-casting (if a previous cast, especially one which worked well isn't present, you tend to lose faith in it. Even if the characters are changed, it can come off as a cop-out). Also, the previous cast worked off well together. K was a no nonsense old timer and J was a fresh rookie but he respected K for his experience and K trusted J's talent and potential to be succesful as his partner and replacement. Thor here comes off as a lazy pretty boy and valkyrie is just another annoying hipster. 6) Winking at the camera. Unless your character is MEANT to do that, winking at the camera with continuity jokes, ESPECIALLY in a reboot comes off as desperate. 7) Unnecessary changes. You shift locations, but there must be a legitimate reason outside of sight seeing. If it is meant to be a reboot, go all the way instead of showing off the previous locations and characters to establish a previous continuity. If it is meant to be a continuation, do that, show and tell another story but make it good. This is too stale to be a reboot and too different to be a sequel. 8) Director quality. When your director is most famous for a Fast and Furious movie which will soon fade from memory, there is a good chance this will too. A movie can survive a couple or more of such warning flags. This trailer however hits ALL of them. A shitty movie can have a great trailer (the Last Jedi), and vice versa but those are exceptions. This doesn't appear to be one. It just gets worse when I watch it again.",0,0,A M

I can tell you already that this movie will not out perform the original M.I.B. Maybe Will Smith will make a quick cameo but, I'm not dropping $20 to see a quick cameo.

2018-12-21T17:14:08Z,"(Depravity of False Teacher according to Apostle Peter):  But these,  as natural brute beasts,  made to be taken and destroyed,  speak evil of the things  that they understand not;  and shall utterly perish  in their own corruption;  (Like natural brute beasts): False teachers are compared to animals in their behavior because they act in ignorance of the realities of death and judgment. Like animals, they also react only to present circumstances, without giving thought to the consequences of their actions).  and will receive  the wages of unrighteousness  as those who count it pleasure  to carouse in the daytime.  they are spots and blemishes  carousing in their own deceptions  while they feast with you,  (False teachers are perverse in their display of evil, like those who carouse in the daytime, Even pagan societies thought it strange and unnatural to hold drunken revels in broad daylight. However, the false teachers had no qualms about practicing their erroneous concept of Christians liberty in clear daylight. As a result, they would receive the wages of unrighteousness, that is, spiritual death. (Romans 6:23)<---For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.  The heretics were so self-deceived that they actually thought they were celebrating their freedom in Christ with their drunken revelry at the Lord's table. In fact, they were spots and blemishes, disfiguring and degrading the purity of the Lord's feast).  Having eyes full of adultery and that (((cannot cease from sin))),  enticing unstable souls. They have a heart  trained in  (((covetous practices))),  and are accursed children.  (The eyes of the false teachers were full of adultery, They looked lustfully at women. they could not cease form sin because their fantasizing had become habitual. As a consequence, they convinced certain unstable souls in the church that adultery was acceptable Christian behavior and lured them into sexual immorality. Enticing means ""to catch with bait."" these new, unstable converts, not yet fully grounded in Christ, were easily booked into an immoral lifestyle).  They have forsaken  the right way  and gone astray,  following the way of Balaam  the son of Beor  who loved the wages of unrighteousness;  But he was rebuked for his iniquity;  a dumb donkey  speaking with a man's voice  restrained the madness  of the prophet.  (The account of Balaam in Numbers 22-24 is used here, as well as in Jude 11 and Rev 2:14, to depict the danger of forsaking the right way and going astray. Balaam's primary downfall was that he loved the wages of unrighteousness. He sold his prophetic powers to the pagan king Balak and, for a promised monetary reward, sought to curse the children of God).  These are wells without water,  clouds carried by a tempest,  for whom is reserved  the blackness of darkness  forever.  (Wells...clouds): Peter accuses the heretical teachers of awakening false expectations, like springs that contain no water or storm clouds that darken but produce no rain).  (2 Peter 2:12-17).",0,0,mlzanercik

Hey! what about that Tessa Thompson character, she seems quite slapstick doesn't she and emotive? No? You think every time she looks at you she's telling you she hates you with her eyes?

Fire Kathleen Kennedy!  This whole Force is Female crap IS Kathleen Kennedy’s fault. I don’t care if it’s The Women in Black from Sony or “Fival Goes West And Genderless” or GhostBuster Disaster of the Chris Helmsworth type. It’s getting ridiculous and majorly desperate of these studios. “What can we do for a cash grab this year” “Oh, I know! The EXACT Same story but a worst version of it... but with women versions INSTEAD” “Ooooo I like your thinking Kath. It’$ going to be a  $ucce$$!”  If you don’t see this happening, well, you’re their perfect audience and Kathleen Kennedy thanks you from her yacht off the Hawaiian Islands.   As for me, I’m getting soooo tired of it and think I’m going to go plant a garden instead. True, a garden is as predictable but at least I get free food out of it. And Kathleen Kennedy can never ruin my favorite garden franchises. The Plants Are Not Female.  When do we get men versions of women stories?!? I can’t wait for for the Little Women sequel of the cash grab title “Little Men.” Or what about Kathleen Kennedy’s newest creation The Little Merman. Sounds more like a porno hahaha. Sigh.

2018-12-21T12:49:23Z,"*I'm upset. My movie got denied by Hollywood. It was a masterpiece. :,(*  It was about a young boy, named Timmy, who decided to go bowling one day.   But he got beat up by some guys for being gay. :( Timmy's big brother couldn't protect him because he went missing 5 years ago when he was out to get some milk at a 7 11. :( Anywayssssss....  Then Timmy went to school principle to tell on them.  The principle decided to make the boy and the group of bullies work on a group project together. The project was to learn how to build a bridge.  The bullies ended up beating him up again till the boy said ""Stop! I'm gay. That doesn't mean you have to beat me up >:, (*  The bullies decided to beat him up some more till one of the bullies, named Chad, said ""Guys. We need to do the project or else we have to repeat the 11th grade.""  Everyone including Timmy worked on the project together. One of the bullies, named Tyrone, couldn't understand the project. Timmy told him and Derrick said ""thanks G"". That made Timmy smile. He became a ""G."" :3  A few seconds later, Derrick said: ""G ... for Gay!"" And everyone beated on Timmy again. But Timmy kept on smiling. :,)  Timmy kept on helping everyone with building the bridge. Derrick and Chad and the rest of the bullies were amazed how smart Timmy was.   ""Hey, maybe we were too harsh on you."" said Derrick.   Everyone smiled.  Timmy: ""Maybe this bridge is more than a project. Maybe it is a metaphor to connect us and help us be friends.""  Everyone except Timmy frowned.  Timmy: ""Or maybe it is a lame project.""  Everyone smiled again.  Then all of a sudden!!!!....Chad's drunk father came out of no where and struck Chad!  Everyone came rushing to Chad. Chad was dying. But he wanted to speak to Timmy. He said to Timmy:   ""I'm sorry Timmy. Being gay is ok. Being a bully is not ok. It is gay to be a bully. People who bully gay people are gay. No. I mean. They just suck. But I have to tell you something.""  Timmy: ""What?"" :, (  Chad: ""I'm your big brother.""  Everyone gasped.  Timmy: ""why didn't you come home when you went out to get the milk 5 years ago?"" :, (  Chad : ""Wait!!! I thought mom wanted some O.J.""  Chad died right after saying that.  Timmy cried. Derrick cried. The rest of the bullies cried.  *In conclusion...*  Timmy decided to be the leader of the bullies that day. Everyone accepted Timmy as their new leader.  Chad's father was sent to prison.   Derrick died 1 week later from pimples.  Before he died, he told Timmy that was he was gay. He wanted Timmy to keep it as a secret.  ....Timmy didn't.

Hollywood doesn’t know when to quit?? 😂 listen I’m gonna see it and if I like it alright but my feelings rn this movie is not gonna be good I’m willing to give it the benefit of the doubt because it’s some great actors in it it’s part of the original MIB universe and that universe is wonderful but I gave Venom the benefit of the doubt too and it did everything I said it would.. be WRONG I’m not sexist or anything however I probably would’ve switched her out with like Kevin Hart because it’d have that nostalgia feel kev would be like Will Smith Chris would be.. hang on Chris isn’t a serious guy.. you guys get my point tho however to the other people complaining a woman shouldn’t be in MIB.. women were in the original.. just not.. one of the MAIN MEN IN BLACK I’m all for women getting the spot light but I’m not gonna hold my breath it’s Feminism a serious titled MEN IN BLACK based on movies with two MALE protagonist now turned into one.. FEMALE protagonist and one Male now if it was a movie about a woman like Wonder Woman or Captain Marvel then it’s still feminisms just not forced feminism either way I’m 50/50 with it.. just gotta wait and see,0,0,Zekken

2018-12-21T09:34:03Z,"Face the facts people: The original Men In Black sequels were hot garbage and they should have never betrayed the first movie by bringing Agent K out of retirement. We will never know how good the sequels could have been without the tommy lee jones time travel and amnesia plots. And anyone who has actually watched the first movie knows Agent L the female agent that became Will Smiths partner at the end of the first movie. They even explain in the sequel how Wills character got rid of her and every other partner he was given before they brought Tommys character back. Theres nothing new about having a female Men in black agent. She and the other female agent were in the movies, they were in the games, they were in the cartoon. Its time to stop.",24,8,Jamie A2Z83

They single handedly screwed up any mystery which the trailer of brighburn should have had coz the trailer intro to the trailer showed it was a horror flick. Luckily this is MiB so they could not screw it up much. Sony - you need to disband your department of stupid ideas which comes up with these ideas...they are sinking your ship.,0,0,madmax

This one is a fresh change of pace with the new cast, and despite the obvious tonal shift at least they are trying to reboot it and change things up a bit.

2018-12-21T03:04:35Z,"I have a theory, what if she is Will Smith’s daughter? Because maybe his character had fallen in love and he could’ve possibly wanted a life with the woman he fell in love with. Similar to Agent K, in the beginning of the third movie we see him living a normal life but, he never truly forgot what it was like being in the Agency. So, let’s say this movie is set far of into the future. And if Will did decide to settle down maybe he didn’t forget about the agency. Which is why he might’ve taught his daughter some of things she might need to know in order to survive (with aliens and humans). Since aliens often portray as humans I assume they would watch over her if they knew who Will was. Maybe she eventually caught on to the secret. Which is why as she got older she managed to figure it out. I assume something happened like maybe Will had passed and she decided to join MIB b/c she knew that she had a place for her as a legacy.",4,0,Alexis Cecilia

She not here for any ""SJW executives wanting to ruin our childhood"". It's because She and Hemsworth has great chemistry with one another. They were both casted after Ragnarok was released, like months after. Also for fans, you guys kinda forgot Agent L existed in the first film, was a major character in the animated series, and Emma Thompson's Agent O in the third film. Speaking of she's in this Trailer. And there's a painting of K and J in there. As in.... ITS NOT A REBOOT! Also yes. Will Smith is not in this film...But really? HE'S the deciding factor? You guys do know that his biggest contributions in the last few years was starring in a Netflix film, appearing in the worst Youtube video ever and literally playing a rapping genie, right?

It seems to have captured the essence of the previous movies and I think it'll be more of a continuation than a remake. Maybe along the lines of what the 007 franchise does. At least I hope so. I've got no issues with the casting and I believe they fit their roles well so far. My only issue with the trailer is that they didn't show more crazy aliens. Also, I hope Will Smith will get a cameo of some sort in the movie. If they stick to the formula of the old movies while not being dull, this has great chances of working out well. I don't expect it to be a masterpiece of any sort, but I think it can be an average or even good fun movie to watch next Summer.",1,1,Antonio Ferreira

The world you inhabit is a place of constant change - more than your mind can absorb without going into shock. Even the body you inhabit is changing relentlessly, in spite of modern science's attempts to prolong youth and life indefinitely. Father God our Creator, Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior, and The Holy Spirit our Comforter and redeemer however, is the same yesterday and today and forever.              Because The Lord never change, your relationship with Him provides a rock-solid foundation for your life. Christ Jesus will never leave your side. When you move from this life to the next, His presence beside you will shine brighter with each step. You have nothing to fear, because Jesus Christ our Lord is always with you for all time and throughout eternity.            Receive Jesus Christ free gift of salvation RIGHT NOW by believing in Him and what He did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection. Ask Him to be your Lord and Savior. Make today the first day of your eternally loving relationship with the One whom created you and loves you so much. ❤️❤️❤️         (Revelation 1 : 8; Hebrew 13 : 8; Psalm 102 : 25-27; Psalm 48 : 14)",2,0,msdogooder

I'm pretty sure that if you would've made it similar to MIB without actually trying to leech off of MIB's success, it would've been fine, as long as it's good, but, seeing what you're trying to do, I don't get the feeling it's gonna be good.",0,0,chadthesaiyan

2018-12-20T22:36:33Z,"Y'all gotta stop with the ""It's MEN in black"" argument. The title men in black comes from a conspiracy of creepy men dressed in black suits showing up to confront/harass people that claim to have seen something extraterrestrial. The conspiracy arose in the late 1940s (at a time when government agents were all men). This is what inspired the series but the agency now exists in 2018 (when now women and men work the same jobs), the title is not meant to reflect the gender of the agents.

2018-12-20T22:00:21Z,"Let me guess the plot of the movie. I’m just basing this off of the buddy cop/spy movies I’ve seen. So they think that Chris Hemsworth is the mole in the company, so they send Tessa Thompson to find out if he is. She hates the way he works but in one adventure, he saves her and they kiss or become good friends. So then they find out that Liam Neeson is the mole after all so they tell them but they don’t believe them so they go after him themselves but he kidnaps one of them, probably Chris cause they’ll want the girl to save the guy. Then the climax of the movie happens where Tessa Thompson tracks them down and saves Chris. Then they have a fight, one of them sacrifices themselves but lives and they either kill or capture Liam Neeson. They work together after that and they’ll set something up for a second movie.  Basically any generic spy movie. They’re just riding on nostalgia to sell tickets and a lot of old fans are going to be upset cause it’s not ”true to the franchise”.

I can guarantee you right now, even if Smith and Jones cameo, this isn't going to match, let alone surpass the success of its predecessors. And even if it does, it won't reignite the franchise long-term.    The story was DONE, this ""expansion"" is a textbook cash grab scenario. When will people learn that sometimes, the best way to respect something we love is knowing when to leave good things ALONE?    Seriously, how many IP's need to be rebooted to laughable or disappointing reception before that age-old lesson sinks in?

2018-12-20T21:27:43Z,People love to hate on trailers. But here's what I'm seeing as a hard MIB fan:   What made the original films great was a a duo that had great chemistry and enjoyable quick wits see it here. The special effects and setting seem to stay true to the establish world from the origin trilogy.    Just because it's a reboot/sequal doesn't mean its automatically going to fail. Makes more sense to build off of a world already established rather than try to make a completely new universe and hope people can fall in (i.e. mortal engines)  I am going to give this film a shot.,63,5,Jesse Gillette

2018-12-20T21:25:49Z,"Will Smith is a stylish but serious policeman, first of all his work - the style only complements it. Linda Fiorentino - a man who hardly believes in what is happening, it surprises her - but she keeps herself in her hands. The role of Tommy Lee Jones is above praise, as hard as a rock, as serious as a subpoena. In the video of the same new part, Chris Hemsworth is still the same recognizable Thor, the son of a rich father who cares more about how he looks than some kind of work on MiB - a boat, parties and (forgive me Chris) from the video - zero IQ (Chris, spit in the one who chooses such roles for you). Tessa Thompson in the trailer looks like a 13-year-old girl, who was first given a Gucci bag (she had dreamed about for a year), the same stylish costume and invited to the most elite party in NY for the first time. And communicate with it, as with the center of the universe. I agree, this is the dream of most teenage girls of 13 years old, they will like the film and the heroine - they will have something to dream about. But there is nothing more serious? The feeling that soon the target audience of most films will be first for schoolchildren, and then even babies, as soon as they are allowed to pay with a parent credit card. What's wrong with you, Sony? I want to see at least one film that will remain in the golden collection even after 50 years, and not the one that fans forget about in a couple of years - when 13-year-old girls become older and more serious ... p.s. Only Liam Neeson can save the situation a little bit - but one actor cannot fix the movie",0,0,Dark Raider

Second, What bothers me most is the callbacks. What new things does this movie show or hint at? Exactly, nothing. Flying and transformative vehicles, hidden guns, neuralizers, we've seen it all before.And the way the movie keeps shoving it down our throats it feels like nostalgia pandering. And third the plot it self...what is it exactly? The first 3 MIBs were straigh foreward. Buddycop movies that were about cathing one alien badguy.With the dynamic between the agents as the focus. But this? What is the dynamic exactly? I couldn't make it out. All in all this trailer is so bland, it tells us nothing but what the characters look like.Congrats. I won't see this movie.

2018-12-20T18:59:31Z,"MIB was good because it was about a character whose life changed, and who worked hard to deal with the changes. Movies require a struggle.  Not a goal, not intensity, not action, not happenings and events, not situations, not setups and results, not comedy, not cinematography, not things the main characters need to get done where they sometimes succeed and sometimes fail.  Struggle.  We humans empathize with struggle because we ourselves want to struggle.  We look up to those who have struggled; and we watch those who have begun to struggle with hope and anticipation.  Instead, this movie has another black woman who has no character development throughout the entire film because the creators were afraid to let black people and women make mistakes that people can learn from. When there's no character development, the only thing that could make the movie good is story progression.  But it looks like there's none of that either, because the characters were always rushing to catch up with the story, which means the story has no time to sit and wait for a development. This movie has no struggle.  This is also clearly trying to be another expanded universe, at least of a sort.  The problem is that this trailer hasn't demonstrated that the universe even allows struggle at all.  That means there won't be any interest in any sequels.  A universe without struggle is a universe without opportunity is a universe without potential.  On the bright side, people can't blame the actors.  It's clearly Sony's fault.",0,4,epigeios

I know Hollywood likes to seemingly force diversity into films nowadays that it throws off plots and stirs up drama, but Tessa Thompson is perfect for this role imo (She killed it as Valkyrie too.) It's not hard for the entertainment industry to make diverse badass characters that don't seem like they are forced into the film to fit an agenda. The character's traits shouldn't revolve around why they are diverse unless it really affects the plot. I think so far from this trailer, they have done a good job.",0,0,welicatiga

Alls we did for this movie it seems like we just took all the male characters that were in the original and replaced them with female characters and that’s supposed to make it better? Or original? No not even close. The originals will always be better. Sorry if you don’t agree but the movie doesn’t look bad but we don’t need it.",0,0,Alex Strouse

Where's the threat of The Bug like monster here that grounded the goofier parts of the first film? It seems everyone is there just to have an attitude and a good time.  Will Smith played it cool but it was funny watching him mess up as he stepped into a world he didn't understand.  This film just looks run of the mill, just like the disappointing MIB2 that got the best parts of the first film so wrong. This new one looks fun, for sure, but nothing in the trail suggested there was a genuine threat, given how the cast look too cool for school.  Maybe there's more to come and it'll not play out like the other sequels but so far... 🤔 meh?",0,0,Randomid

2018-12-20T16:34:38Z,"I’m really excited for this, been on a MIB marathon for the past few days and this is looking good imo. Love the ascetic, musical choice, more sifi tone, it’s looking good imo. Also Sony, don’t even pretend you’re not referencing Thor, I see that hammer.  But seriously, what’s with the hate, some of it is partially justified but others is just stupid people being stupid.  Like any of you talking about a title change or how a female lead goes against the franchise. Did you even watch the MIB films, The ending of 1 had the girl from the morgue become agent L and J’s partner. Female agents were shown working at MIB in headquarters in scenes throughout the whole trilogy. And O was a secondary character in MIB 3. The organisation is called MIB, hence the title, and that monicker is based off the creepypasta of the Men in Black. MIB doesn’t require being a dude. I’m no SJW or anything but seriously the hate isn’t necessary.  The only criticism I’ve seen that I’ll even slightly accept (although I haven’t seen anyone properly express it) is the whole Hollywood originally thing. To which I say, Firstly this is a spin-off, not a reboot, your MIB is still cannon. Secondly, MIB is already a big franchise with 3 films, games, and a TV show, and it’s a unique franchise at that, going for a sifi-buddy cop comedy genre, with spy and camp elements. Imo that mix of genres is pretty rare, so why are you mad we’re getting more of it. If you’re mad at this then be mad at everything that came after MIB 1.",0,0,Samuel Turner

Because as soon as Roger Moore or Patrick Troughton or Patrick Stewart or Adam West or... whoever played Sherlock Holmes after the first of maaaaaany adaptations had taken over each respective show, there'd have been a bunch of people on  the internet down-voting the trailers and whining about the absence of the original cast.

2018-12-20T16:00:16Z,Chris Hemsworth talking very much like Thor here really takes me out of this. Couldn't he just have used his Australian accent? I know it's set in London but it's MIB: International. His character could be an aussie in this movie. It's really jarring hearing his Thor voice in this trailer and probably will be in the movie too. 😕,0,0,Jonathan Southwell

2018-12-20T15:56:08Z,"This... actually doesn't look half bad. It's actually pretty neat seeing a new division to the MIB universe while still showing it is in the same universe as the original three. The tone at least from this trailer seems to go back to the first MIB, which the second and third failed to recreate. After Thor Ranarok, it is exciting to see Chris and Tessa work together again, and seeing Liam Neeson as an MIB agent makes me wonder how they never thought about having him do this before. I think he's an amazing choice to be in the MIB. One thing in the comments section I am seeing is people are irritated by Tessa Thompson's role as an agent when the film is called Men In Black, and I don't really get their point. Yes, she is female. I also understand a female reboot of Ghostbusters came out in 2016 to generally negative reviews from the fan side of things. Firstly, this is not Ghostbusters. We don't know the actual quality of the film we will be receiving, however going off the trailers available this seems to be going in a better direction. Secondly the previous films contained female agents L and O. Agent O is even in this trailer. Lastly, who cares if the title says ""Men""? We've had an entire film series called X-Men which starred females as mutants. In any case, these are fiction anyway and can set the rules of their universe however they want. If it comes out and contains ""I'm strong because I'm a woman"" scenes, then I would see where you are coming from, but this trailer doesn't indicate anything special about her gender, and we don't have the full movie yet. Well now that the rant is out of the way, I'll end by saying I am more interested then I thought I'd actually be for this movie and can't wait to see more of it.",19,2,Travis Mackie

Since agent O is there is safe to assume is in the same ""universe""  persay.   Big bonus if will smith and Tommy could make an appearance.  Like a short a screen time or heck even a phone call.  (since i know will is working on a project right now)   And as much as i love the original mib.  The first one is not perfect but has a special place in my heart and mib 2 and 3 is a big meh, Some parts  is inconsistent but its not terrible.   So i wouldn't go as far to say this new mib international is "" ruining the original "" or ""ruining my childhood""  or whatever people are whining about right now.    And plus.  We have Liam,  thor and valkry in here.  If this movie goes well and they want to make another mib international.  Its a no brainer that the next one has to have will and tommy.
