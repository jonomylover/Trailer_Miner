I never saw the ninja zombie being used at all with the main characters. When the blond started acting funny like she's turning into a zombie after eating trail mix (she had a nut allergy) in the car they never tried to figure out what happened or why she was looking like she was turning.  Movie was pretty good but they could've done things better.,0,0,AngryELTrucker

What's funny is that it feels like it's he intention whithin the metanarrative, like all culture stopped when the zombies attacked.

Everything point on it. This film is out of this world. A Bimbo Blonde in a zombie apocalypse when you can barely find one in Canada/North America that is not pimped yet. Completely unrealistic to the current world and disconnected from the future. This film won't live long past his history.,0,0,Ultimate Warrior X2

2019-09-19T00:06:08Z,"Night of The Wild: Animal Apocalypse is a upcoming 2021 American natural apocalyptic horror-comedy film directed by Ruben Fleischer and written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick.   The film stars Will Ferrell, Adam Scott, Chris Rock, John C. Reilly, Jack Nicholson, Tim Allen, Woody Harrelson, Tom Hanks and Jack Black.  The film is scheduled to be released on October 18th, 2019 in the United States and Canada, with a October 25th, 2021 release date in the Philippines and Australia.  Premise  Two years after the events of the first film, the Earth is in complete abandoned ruin as Will Ferrell, Adam Scott, John C. Reilly and Chris Rock go on a action-packed adventure to freedom with four eccentrically friendly gun-toting animal-slaving survivors as they battle, shoot and kill many of the new species of mutant animals, including ones that have evolved into genetically modified monsters, zombie animals created by the recent spreading of the toxic waste, twisted animal monster hybrids created by a gang of mad scientists called The AVD, a giant genetically engineered zombie Tyrannosaurus rex hybrid known as Agent 4783 and demonic versions of the animals in order to save themselves from permanent extinction.",0,0,The Rainbow DJ Wolf 13 USA RockStar Hero Show

2019-08-30T23:33:17Z,"This comment selection is kind of toxic for ""Saving Spider-Man"" comments. It's not Sony's fault they want to take away Spider-Man from Disney. It's Disney's fault because they wanted more money when they have gotten enough. So it's time to take some steps back from Disney from their six billion dollar box office streak. And Stan Lee's daughter knows Disney treated his father over Spider-Man awfully. First of all you love the hell out of the PS4 Spider-Man game, and Into the Spider-Verse. You forgot about those? Oh yes, you're just a bunch of Disney white slaves/MCU fanboys on spent your life admiring the MCU like it's the Holy Grail or the King of the Hollywood industry. Enough is enough, Sony pulled Spider-Man back because Disney's super greedy and Stan Lee's daughter is sides with Sony. I don't care if you're all not going to see Sony's movies because you're poor sack of shits.   Fight me you toxic, Jeremy Conrad, behaving poor fat stack of whiny crybaby, living your mother's basement, MCU fanboy cunts. You send death threats to the Russo brothers for not adding Hawkeye in Infinity War, you bullied Lexi Rabe for being not being black for Iron Heart.   Don't even try to say I'm a DC or DCEU fanboy, hahaha. I love both of Marvel and DC. And I know some DCEU films sucks. You losing Spider-Man is how DCEU fans feel when Justice League sucked. How does it feel you bunch of Disney slaves? :p",1,2,Fredinator84

She smelled of cinnamon and vanilla. It was intoxicating, it was alluring, it was like a drug. He watched the girl sitting in the back of the lecture room intently. Her smooth, brown skin drew him in. Her big brown eyes caused his heartbeat to spiral out of control. Mason eyed her curves and her full thighs. She was absolutely stunning. Her thick hair was out and about, being controlled by only by a headband. He watched her annoyed expression as she pulled  a stray hair out of her face and tuck it behind her ear. He nearly smiled at the simple action leaving his dear friend Alex speechless. Mason never smiles.    Before Alex could question his future alphas actions he heard a low growl.

We who once faced those who were in such fear of our power that they sealed us away and banished us to the edge of the galaxy! US! As if THAT loveliness wasn’t enough, they tried to erase our very existence from history! RUDE! Only through our magic were we able to overcome their science and achieve great prosperity! We alone were responsible for stopping that repulsive nightmare of a galactic crisis, yet this is how you repay us! This won’t stand! It won’t be forgiven! It won’t be forgotten! Never ever EVER! Those who called us mad, are you listening? You left us at the edge of the galaxy to be forgotten, then went along your merry way, probably living somewhere pretty and peaceful! But know this! Your future is a farce! You have none! We, masters of a matter most dark, vow to be restored, as foretold in the book of legend, which everyone thought was just a fairy tale! It WASN’T! We have already obtained the vessel that contains our Dark Lord, and he will soon awaken and shower us in compassion! Look! The vessel of our Dark Lord is filling up even as we speak!

This is a sequel to a ten year old movie that was quietly announced months ago and only acknowledged again a couple days before the first trailer and is set to be released in just around two and a half months... should I be worried? I don't necessarily doubt that this will be a good movie far from it and I also I'm sure that there was a lot of pre-production so I expect a solid script as well as good presentation because I doubt this takes that much budget like you could this with just over a million but still for this to sort of come out of nowhere being made in what feels like a year or less and is being released so soon after it's official promotional material has been released and not to mention again he made a full decade after its previous title and well after the zombie media craze of the late 00s early 10s has passed, the one that Zombieland was basically made as both a spoof and authentic part of.... it feels real late to make a sequel yes I've wanted to sequel sure the original stands on its own but there is wiggle room and potential for more stories with these characters and I have always wanted one if only one... but you can see my concern here not necessarily for the quality of the product but of its chances at the market of the day... just all these circumstances I've noticed surrounding it gives me reason to think that this was just a case of producers sitting on an IP for so long and sorta having an opportunity to use it although they're not really interested. That this is being made just to fill out a schedule... to release a movie on a date because we need to have a movie released at this point in the year. Just mild concerns",0,0,Christian Schmude

I pay attention to politics that surround our world today as much as possible, but not everything has to involve them.
