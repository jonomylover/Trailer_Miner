2020-06-04T06:10:18Z,"Perfect timing for me - the Beatles came out when I was 13, and ready for new music.  Would they be popular today, starting out? Impossible to answer - they wouldn't be the same people, with the same background. It's like asking if, say, Billie Eilish would have been popular in 1964. She surely wouldn't have had green hair!  And what if they were from a non-English country? Even Germany? Could they sell that sound in the States? Or GB? It would be an uphill battle. But even so - as good as they were, they had plenty of competition back then.  I'm glad I remember them! (but could I remember all the words?) And I loved the movie. Especially Lilly! And that painter who lived on the beach...",0,0,Jon Doe

But think about it, there are actually a lot of plot similarities between these two movies:  - Jack Malik starts out as an unsuccessful musician, that no one cares for. Oscar starts out as a whale washer that no one cares for. - Jack realizes, after the blackout, that the Beatles no longer exist. He then takes full-on advantage of this by making a music career out of their songs, becoming the biggest and most successful “musician” to ever live. - Oscar realizes, after the anchor kills Frankie, that everyone thinks he killed the shark himself. He then takes full on advantage of this by becoming the “Shark Slayer”, that everyone in the ocean automatically idolizes.  - There is a gold digger in each of this movie that become “associated” with the protagonist just because they want to be big and famous too (Deborah in Jack’s case, Lola in Oscar’s) - There is a woman in love with both protagonists that never confess their feelings for him until it’s too late, but end up with him anyways for plot (Ellie in Jack’s case, Angie in Oscar’s) - Both of the lies that they live later come back to haunt them, and they learn and grow from the mistake of living a lie. They later go back to their normal lives, and realize that they’re the same person that they’ve always been, and don’t need to be rich and famous to be a somebody.   Am I really the only one that’s noticed all the similarities? Because, in a way, these two are practically the same movie.",0,0,jlt61598

Great performances too from Himash Patel and Lily James, who was in the second Mamma Mia film.

Lennon is alive and is an artist. When they ask JL he’ll say he didn’t write them, wasn't even a musician. So there was no need for Jack to admit the truth because in his world it wasn’t the truth. Give the songs away but he should’ve made up another reason. It was a silly ending, so underwritten. It also felt like half Beatles half Ed Sheeran commercial, not that he needs it, but I imagine to take part they had to place his stuff all over it. I’d give the film an 8/10 for the idea but 5/10 for how it turned out. Ellie’s going to be a big star and Rocky, Jack I’m not so sure. His manager stole every scene she was in.",1,2,linclinc5

These same critics didn't rate Ferris bueller's Day off and Star Wars very highly, but I challenge anyone to say they only watched those movie's just once.  A great date movie and the music was played almost the entire length of each song.  Compared to Rocket Man, it's not even close. I will probably watch it on TV again and again and not change the channel.  9 out of 10. Fantastic movie. Must see. There is a surprise in the movie I can not give away, but Ed Sheeran is awesome.

They're still popular today because parents and grandparents have passed them down; but nobody would turn away from their modern music to listen to songs that sound like they should have been written 40 to 50 years ago. And how is he supposed to explain the more ""out there"" songs like: 'Yellow Submarine', 'Strawberry Fields Forever', 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds', 'I am the Walrus', etc.? Plus, there's no trace of the Beatles or their songs... you're expecting me to believe that he knows every word, every note, and every chord to EVERY single Beatles song?

They were paid to do that and there wasn't that many of them I'm not saying it didn't cause other true fans to act crazy every once in awhile but it really was not that big of a thing like they made it out to be so are you guys are liars but you're going to be exposed any day now I'm loving it to Waban at this it's great it's going to be so funny especially when they find out you guys actually think there's like an abandoned spaceship somewhere and you need human DNA in the blood to go repower your spaceship because you guys actually think you're trapped here on Earth with us😂💀😂💀😂💀 I mean I always knew I was living in the Twilight Zone but I didn't actually know that I was like really living in the Twilight Zone.

They also mentioned Coldplay, which of course wouldn’t have come to be without The Beatles. It’s just a fact.

The reason why almost everyone from Earth forgot the music of the past was because the planet was invaded twice, and the internet was destroyed both times. Thus, all knowledge from 2137 AD and prior was lost. Except from these uploaded brain people, who replay the music of old to new generations of humans and aliens alike.

2019-04-12T19:04:51Z,"to be brutally honest, i think this film looks terrible. it looks like the type of movie that its some cheesy comedy romance type genre. also, if you take a good look at it its literally just a film about some random guy i never seen in my life before singing covers of the beatles songs all throughout. and then in the end its just going to be a huge advertisement to get people to listen to his music on spotify.    im really especially not excited for the day it comes out because it's going to be just like when borhap came out, a bunch of young people will suddenly decide they like the beatles but in reality are slightly forcing themselves to enjoy it just because they saw a film of some random guy singing covers of their songs that made them think the band would be interesting to them.  i say this because i just find it disappointing they're going to be hearing it from him first instead of the actual beatles   all in all, it wouldve been a better idea to make a beatles biopic that's actually about all four of them instead of making people keep hoping theres a less than 10 minute long cameo of paul and ringo saying ""thats our music!!"" to the guy whos been singing their music.",0,0,servaI

This has a lot of potential to be something special, and I hope that they really don't let us down. Even if the trailer is a bit generic, there's no denying the charm and spectacle that it inspires.

He visited it every episode, and the main thing was that he mainly went to a pub there, and played Beatles songs on its piano which people loved, and they would say: ""It's great but I've never heard of it."", to which he would say ""You will.""  In the end, he took the credit that he'd written them himself.  So this looks like another Gen. Y copy of an older, truly original idea, simply modernised with 'the Mandela effect' scenario.

2019-02-17T14:26:23Z,"Well cool as an idea but beatles are the fathers of pop music. Each thing they came up with and they experimented: chord progressions, variations, and a long etc. After them, lots of musician have take their investigations, beatles chord progressions, etc. They were the inspiration for many musicians. If they wouldn't exist, it would have been another ""beatles"" in the 60,s even 70,s that would have experimented with music. Therefore the whole film doesn't make sense and its gonna be full of ""funny"" gags and that's it. No coldplay without beatles (as coldplay is mentioned in the video) at least they would sound different. So the alternative present in this movie should have been very different. I think it that would be the interesting point to approach in the movie. How music would sound without the beatles as we know them. Who would have been the fathers of pop music. Then this guy appears with beatles songs and it makes the world go mad.",0,2,Zape00

2019-02-15T23:58:37Z,"At the end of the trailer for this film we see that he's on a talk show and two men are claiming to be the writers of the songs. That's obviously going to be Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr. So what if we discover, this world in which the beatles never happened was something that the original remaining members actually wished for because the trappings of fame and celebrity were just too much. They just wanted to live a normal life for the rest of their days. But at the same time they're wishing for this, this dude is wishing to be the next beatles. So it becomes this sort of Freaky Friday scenario. Where the dude got his wish to become one of the greatest artists to exist, but he slowly turns into somebody thinking he's better than he is. So he loses the girl, then realises how the music industry doesn't actually care about the artists or the music they make. And the movie becomes sort of about how, the beatles couldn't exist today, because the music industry would have too much influence over what they would sound like. (I.e Hey Jude becomes Hey Dude). So this man goes out to find the real beatles and they work to change things back to the way they were. Probably by playing Yesterday or something. And then he gets the girl, happy ending. But my point is this movie seems really silly but there could be a lot of really interesting themes. Like, what is influence vs plagiarism, or how giant record labels are soul sucking, and how fame changes people. So it could be really interesting. Although presumably in this world, John Lennon wasn't brutally assassinated and was just sort of, hit by a car instead or something. So I don't know how they're going to cover that subject in a way that doesn't feel tasteless. but we'll see.",0,0,Alex P

2019-02-15T22:53:11Z,"The fact that so many books still name the Beatles as ""the greatest or most significant or most influential"" rock band ever only tells you how far rock music still is from becoming a serious art. Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success. The Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers.
