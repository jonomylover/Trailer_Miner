2020-05-16T04:01:10Z,"This film is not a tribute to our heroes. The idiots of Hollywood know nothing about the honorability and conduct of real men. They have to depict them as wild west cowboys always poised to get into fist fights to prove they're real men. And Woody Harrelson is the worst casting in film history. Not only is he a horrible actor, his juvenile  voice still sounds like he wants to check with Sam again for the ingredients of a rum and coke. The 1970s film on Midway was much more intelligent and a superior film overall.",1,0,Ed Baker

The one thing that annoys me is that a movie like 1917 will get all the awards and reviews and people will say its a must watch but  then a good movie like midway will get no awards and bad reviews. Just goes to show the type of audiences that movie companies have to cater for nowadays. 1917 was mainly symbolic and academic and i found the acting was weak. They were trying to save 1600 men when in most battles in the entirety of ww1 more than 60 000 men were killed. Now you have a movie like midway which had good acting and historically very accurate and it gets bad reviews. Please go watch the movie before giving bad reviews.",1,0,Chaplain

2020-03-08T14:40:35Z,"One flaw in the film is the treatment of torpedo bomber pilot Ensign George Gay.  Gay's plane was shot down and crashed into the sea in the middle of the Japanese fleet. Although his gunner did not survive the crash, Gay did.  With the help of a life vest and a seat cushion, Gay treaded water while being surrounded by Japanese ships.  (Of course the attention of the Japanese was directed mostly skyward at the time but it was still a miracle that Gay did not get plucked out of the Pacific by one of the sons of Nippon.)  Gay essentially had a wet but front-row seat from which to watch the most important naval battle of World War II.  Through some sort of miracle he was never spotted up by the Japanese. After the battle he was picked up by an American ship.   The film shows a torpedo pilot in the water witnessing the events of the battle as they unfolded but it never identifies that pilot as George Gay.  Even worse, the film fails to explain that that same pilot survived the battle.  That's a shame because Gay's story is an amazing one. Maybe the filmmakers left it out because they thought the audience would simply not believe it.   By the way, Gay survived the war and went on to be a pilot for TWA.",0,0,Leif Johnson

The movie doesn't even mention the fate of vice admiral nagumo after the battle.   However the things i didn't like the movie is the way they portrayed the Japanese crews and officers. They doesn't looks like soldier. They looks so SOFT, like someone who watch lot of anime while the US crews looks more bad ass. I watched lots of documentary about pacific war, and the japanese soldiers don""t looks like that. They are tough, rough and scary sometimes.   Overall, it was a good movie.

The IJN was capable of holding off the Royal navy so that the Wehrmacht could land on Britain and make the kill.  Afterwards Japan would received all European colonies in Asia free of fight. He could have convinced Hitler by luring him to look forward to joining forces to invade the USA after Britain, which, would not happen because both Hitler and Japan would be too busy enjoying their trophies in Europe and in Asia.  Both Hitler and Japan high command were thinking they were the big bosses in their own separate war theater was the dumbest thing in WW2.  They are no evils but plain stupid.

And these guns could only fire...at best...20 rounds per minute. As was the case on the other Japanese carriers that were equipped with the same guns. BUT HOLLYWOOD WOULD HAVE YOU BELIEVE THEIR 45.CAL. GUNS COULD FIRE 200 ROUNDS PER MINUTE. When you watch the movie you'll see what I mean. Typical Hollywood...BULLSHIT! Nothing and nobody could ever fly through the BULLSHIT FLACK that is coming up from the decks of the Japanese carriers! As usual, Hollywood overcooked this war movie too.

Now this movie i'll just say that i was expecting more,  at least at the same level as SavingPvtRyan.  But oh well, at least us ww2 pacific war junkies got something new and fresh to enjoy watching.

While the movie certainly isn't perfect, and obviously isn't Oscar material, it is a really good movie that is entertaining, well made, and does a great job remembering the heroes of Midway. I know the CGI caught some criticism but i honestly thought there was no problems with it. It may not be the best CGI, but the negative reviews of the CGI definitely were not fair. The CGI got the job done and the actor's performances were top notch, the direction was top notch giving plenty of drama and cinematic action, and was probably one of the most historically accurate war movies i've ever seen, if not the most accurate. The level of historical detail at times is incredible, especially the scenes regarding the Submarine USS Nautilus.    If i had to choose between an average movie with really good CGI and average acting, or a really good movie with average CGI and good acting, I'm going to choose the really good movie every time. LEt's not forget this was the largest budget for an independent movie ever, and so they didn't have alot of resources. They got incredible actors like Woody Harrelson, Dennis Quaid, Aaron Eckhart in supporting roles. Not counting Ed Skrein, Patrick Wilson, and Luke Evans. Even Nick Jonas was really good in this movie surprisingly. Much rather they spend the money on acting rather than CGI.",1,0,Assasin of Eire

2019-11-18T07:37:45Z,"I initially had mixed feelings about this movie while watching it, but walked out satisfied overall. Roughly the first quarter or so of the movie is a bit hard to get into and feels cluttered and jumbled with various plot-lines, and it's not entirely clear who the main character is supposed to be, at first. It very much had a sort of panoramic scope. After that, though, the plot comes together coherently; I enjoyed the various cuts of perspective between admirals/officers (American and Japanese), code-breakers and pilots. It ended up having surprisingly memorable characters given my initial impression, and the battle scenes were overall enjoyable and properly built tension; the CGI sometimes felt transparently fake, though it was mostly forgivable given other positive aspects, IMO. The plot is rewarding and historically accurate, and takes very little liberties. It didn't feel like a schlocky popcorn film as the trailers seem to more so suggest. Also, to risk spoiling anything, an aspect of the battles that was particularly great was the utter futility that you felt when the guys were going in for bombing runs; the casualty rate + ratio of hit to miss was pretty sobering and made the more positive moments all the more satisfying. I would definitely recommend even in spite of its flaws, especially if you're already into historical war films.",0,0,Rico Maria Rico

The CGI was a little rough and could have been better, they really tried to get too many battles in the film when each deserves a film of its own.  All in all, it was OK 5/10.

2019-11-13T19:40:57Z,"Man, I hate what they do with 21st century CGI.  The trailer makes it look like 200 planes are diving on a carrier at once.  That's comic strip stuff.  A flight of aircraft peel off and dive in sequence, dropping in sequence, dodging anti-aircraft fire from multiple ships, to put a 500 lb bomb on target.  That is heroic stuff, regardless if the pilot is Japanese or American.  The entire reason that the Americans were successful was mostly an accident of fate, i.e. rather than torpedo bombers (low), dive bombers (high), and fighters (protection, overwatch) arriving at the same time, the torpedo bombers arrived first, and all but one was lost.  An entire squadron was lost.  However, the Japanese CAP was drawn down to near the surface of the water, while perusing the slow, antiquated, ""sitting duck"" torpedo bombers, so the carriers had no fighter protection when the dive bombers made their runs.   Read some history, folks.  Hope this movie is good, but it's likely that it corrupts history for a good $Hollywood Story$.  The history of the men who fought this battle was simply heroic.

It portrays the build up from pearl harbour to the battle of midway in a clear way and implementing stories of real people into it.   I saw this trailer at first and thought ah god another crappy hollywood movie but no. Its filled with action yes but it doesnt stop to show the major events such as planning (which i might add is great as it is not just oh look the enemy is there it shows that they were unsure ,which again adds to the pressure, and it was partially  a guess) and adds pressure by the consequences of losing.  Like i said the characters in this movie were real. At the end it shows you their names and what they did.  It also does not shy away from some gritty things like the young men who were scared of losing their lives and who in action sequences did.  Please go see this movie.

One of the main characters that is a pilot on enterprise talks like he is the jack black character from tropic thunder. He’s always at 100 percent, and it’s totally unbelievable. No one talks like that, and his performance completely took me out of the movie. I don’t know why the movie studios think all service members are gun ho motivated all the time, and for some reason no one act normal, and everyone is completely over the top. I don’t get it.

2019-11-05T14:36:09Z,As the events in Naval History during WWII tells us - Battle of Midway (1942) was the turning point in War in the Pacific. US Navy had won a decisive Victory despite being hopelessly outnumbered by the Imperial Japanese Navy. The Jap Imperial Fleet compromised of a sizeable enemy Task Force - 4 Aircraft Carriers battleships Cruisers destroyers n submarines. Those Carriers had attacked Pearl Harbour on Dec 7th 1941. US Navy Task Force comprised of only 3 Aircraft Carriers Cruisers and destroyers.  After Peral Harbour n Coral Sea it was Midway. It was USS YORKTOWN ENTERPRISE & HORNET  V/s AKAGI KAGA SORYU & HIRYU. The Trailer seems exciting n the movie is War & Action Drama based on true War Story. Lookin forward for its release.

It only took them around 2 years to establish a very strategic and well-put defenses on the island which means they long gone prepared for this war. The Japanese weren't after us but only for their American enemies. The Japanese won the first war. There are only few American soldiers captured compared to the Filipinos who just happened to be living near that doomed island. The infamous Bataan Death march followed which took several thousand lives of my country men. All this happened after the American colonized our country. To this day, I am still in awe at their extreme lack of understanding of the situation, thinking we should be thankful to them while in fact, they were the one who brought chaos to our country.

Since Pearl Harbor (2001), Hollywood and the historical content is similar with mixing water with oil. I hope that Roland and  other great historical shows kill off this trend for good. I honestly don't give two sh!ts whether the CGI is at its best or  what it was 5 years ago. GCI alone is fucking expensive, and I would appreciate a well written, S tier story   for Midway. Lets be honest, It would be pretty shitty for Hollywood to turn one of the greatest naval battles in history into a dumpster fire just for a few blokes complaining about DUH GAPHICS!

Could be pretty cool. Who drew up their plan? America? Ok Tojo, here is a ton of money, bomb pearl harbor we will let you do it to get our boys angry and in to the war. Pearl harbor would have been a huge staging area for them and would have been really hard for America to take back with them bombing our shipyards and airfields on the west coast. The Pacific fleet would also not have been rebuilt. They could have put subs all around our coast lines to try and pick off ships. Another way they could have won would have been don't touch America! When Germany was 19 miles from Moscow and all the factories moved near Siberia, Japan could have used their air power to bomb them. I still think the world would be the same today, war seems like a game. We conquered Mexico city a few hundred years ago and just walked away. Conquered Germany and Japan and just walked away. Really sad for all the men that died in those wars. Why do I think it's a game? I think in WW I . well I can't even remember who was on who's side. Every war people switch sides. We saved China and Russia and the minute WW II was over they became our enemies and Japan and Germany became our allies. I really lost track of it all starting from WW I. I do know after WW I there was a huge arms race building battleships between America, Japan and England. Nobody had any clue who was going to be on who's side. Wonder if they draw straws.

2019-10-20T23:25:26Z,"There are scenes in this trailer that seem like Hollywood sensationalism, however, some of the scenes really did happen.  Examples:  - The scene where Bruno Guido (Nick Jonas) is in the airplane on the deck shooting at a Japanese bomber, then the bomber slices the tail of the plane off as it is shot down.  That really happened, that is NOT Hollywood!!  After that attack Bruno was immediately called up to the bridge by Admiral Halsey and promoted from Aviation Machinists Mate 3rd class to 1st class.  Unfortunately, later in the battle Guido's plane was shot down.  The pilot and Bruno were picked up by a Japanese destroyer, interrogated and then, with gun shells tied to their feet, thrown over board. - A whole squadron of Dauntless dive bombers attacking one Japanese carrier, true again.  When the dive bombers finally discovered the Japanese fleet and dove to attack the pilots were so excited they all pretty much went for the same ship.  Some realized this and broke off to attack a different ship.  Also, bombers and torpedo planes do have guns that face forward for the pilot to use, they're just not the best dog fighters.  But they do have the ability to dog fight if necessary.  I will say that the ships protecting the carriers, both US and Japanese, are way too close to the carriers.  The ships did form defensive rings around the carriers but they were spread out far more then what we are seeing in the trailer/movie.  As for those who are saying the explosions look fake, may I ask what your (real world) references are to compare them too?  I have never seen a real 500 lb. armor piercing bomb explode on a ship.  The days of dive bombers and torpedo planes have long passed any of us seeing what kind of an explosion they make.  I'm sure there are a few who have commented who have seen how an air dropped bomb explodes but I'm willing to wager not as many as there are making the comments.  I am looking forward to the movie and hope to be entertained, I also hope that they do keep the Hollywood ""seasoning"" (as one commenter put it) to a minimum.",0,1,scrag2841

The Kido Butai was under continuous air attack for hours. The success of the handful of planes that made the decisive attack could be traced to the efforts of all the previous attacks degrading the air CAP over the enemy carriers.  In addition, there WERE NO PLANES ON THE ENEMY CARRIERS DECK. The IJN did NOT warm up strike aircraft on the deck like USN carriers. They were warmed up in the HANGER...which is why the bomb hits were so devastating.

2019-09-27T18:10:08Z,"Praying this film gets the realism it deserves. Barely no one today knows of the importance of the battle of Midway. Japan had destroyed the American battleships at pearl harbour and destroyed HMS Repulse and HMS Prince of Wales on the same day, then conquered the whole of south east Asia defeating the Americans in the Philippines and the British at Singapore and now was threatening Australia. The UK were too committed fighting Nazi Germany in Africa and the Mediterranean to send enough help, the Russians were losing to major German Offensives on the Eastern front literally everything hinged on the Americans winning this battle to stop the relentless Japanese advance. The film “DUNKIRK” used a real Supermarine spitfire and the sense of realism was iconic. Surely on a Hollywood budget a Kate or a Devastator Torpedo bomber, a Val or a Dauntless dive bomber or a Zero or a Wildcat fighter can be built and flown using original paint schemes? CGI doesn’t cut it for such a pivotal battle in world history. If the US would’ve lost the Japanese would have invaded midway then Hawaii then from there it could threaten California.

Yes I am talking about the Micheal Bay CGI mess fest. This looks like more of that and that isn't a compliment. I love WWII period films. But Tora Tora Tora is a far better film than Pearl Harbor ever was. You know what made Tora Tora Tora, or A Bridge Too Far or hell even Gettysburg; so damned good? The use of practical effects and attention to authenticity. The B-17 that lands on one wheel in Tora Tora Tora? That was real, flown by a real pilot. The Zero that crashes into a hangar? That was real too, they launched the Zero down a chute packed with explosives. The P-40 that veers wildly and explodes on the runway after being strafed by zeroes? That was real too. It was controlled electrically.  You know the line in the trailer about ""We believe the target is Midway"" and we then hear ""Washington disagrees."" This I find hard to believe.  Do you know where the Office of Naval Intelligence was in 1943? That's right...Washington DC.   The Americans had been decoding Japanese communications since 1942. This was made evident at midway.   ""Since early 1942, the US had been decoding messages stating that there would soon be an operation at objective ""AF"". It was initially not known where ""AF"" was, but Commander Joseph Rochefort and his team at Station HYPO were able to confirm that it was Midway: Captain Wilfred Holmes devised a ruse of telling the base at Midway (by secure undersea cable) to broadcast an uncoded radio message stating that Midway's water purification system had broken down.[54] Within 24 hours, the code breakers picked up a Japanese message that ""AF was short on water"".[55] No Japanese radio operators who intercepted the message seemed concerned that the Americans were broadcasting uncoded that a major naval installation close to the Japanese threat ring was having a water shortage, which could have tipped off Japanese intelligence officers that it was a deliberate attempt at deception.""  While I don't have any records I find it hard to believe that the Commander in Chief would not be kept abreast of the situation of by his advisors and staff.

2019-09-14T02:23:38Z,"1942 japan launch the battle of midway with admiral nagumo which he was on the carrier akagi which is an amagi class battlecruiser which was converted to a carrier after the washington naval treaty along with kaga a tosa class dreadnaught now a carrier, nagumo and yamaguchi which yamaguchi was in the hiryu carrier a step sister ship to the soryu participated how ever there was supposed to be 2 more carrier, you see japan had 7 carrier in midway instead of 9(except the ryujo a medium carrier of the 5th division kido butai) the 2 carrier were in the same division of the 6th fleet division these carrier would become legendary and the backbone of japanese navy these were the shokaku and zuikaku, both participated in battle of coral sea 1942 with admiral takeo supporting the port morseby invasion with the shoho.  Meanwhile america saw this and the australian too which both sent ships to intervene the task force was task force 17 with uss lexington and uss yorktown against the japanese MO division fleet with shokaku and zuikaku however i will not discuss more about this battle as its too long and is derailing my midway knowledge however this battle couldve turn the tide if takeo wasnt a passive man and went full on aggressive and if they manage to torpedo yorktown 3 time it couldve grounded her from midway and made the 2 shokaku carrier able to participate midway as planned.  Anyways 1942 japan had sent one of the most powerful and only multi task carrier division which is the kido butai this consisted of 10 carrier, 1st carrier division akagi kaga, 2nd carrier division hiryu soryu, 3rd carrier division zuiho hosho, 4th carrier division taiyo ryujo and finally the 6th carrier division zuikaku and shokaku.  As japan prepared they had around 7 carrier ready for midway akagi, kaga, soryu, hiryu, zuiho, hosho and taiyo.  4 fleet carrier was sent in the main fleet, 1 light carrier sent in the reinforcement division and 2 escort sent in the transport division there plan was to take midway and lure the american carrier little did they know this plan was about to bite them back as american code breaker found out about this plan thinking it was alaska but admiral chester nimitz knew japan wouldnt be sending a fleet in alaska but more in midway so task force 17 and 16 was sent which was yorktown enterprise and hornet now what many people dont know is that akagi and kaga had the best torpedo squadron in the navy. Soryu and hiryu had the best dive bomber squadron in the navy and shokaku and zuikaku had the best fighter squadron in the navy however they wil lose because of the lack of intel and plane up in the sky.  Japan sent d3y2 val, b5n kate and a6m3 zero to silent midway now nagumo thought it would take 1 wave to finish of midway meanwhile he had his offebsivr carrier squadron in the hanger for the offense but a japanese officer alerted him that they needed a 2nd wave, he didnt knew the american were here so he decided to refit his kate with 500kg bomb to silent midway all 90 will need a refit meanwhile america was sending b26 to bomb them which was ineffective because hitting a moving carrier in long range is harder then you think.  Nagumo launched scout plane like the pete to get intel which was launched by cruisers unlike american where the americans launched scout planes by there carrier and there cruiser the japanese kept there carrier plane in hangar for an attack, this is where a problem comes up many historian believes if he had doubled the scout planes he wouldve had the intel come faster but he didnt as he thought there would be no american carrier yet however his officer came to him and told him that an enemie carrier has been spotted, he was suprised and told the crew to rearmed the kate with torpedo luckily there was only 26 kate with 500kg bomb but the attack of american devestator was about to begin with japan 58 zero on the skys holding off the devestator the japanese french 25mm guns burst in air as this was the battle that made the 25mm gun useful but only because it was facing an outdated torpedo plane.  After the onslaught of devestator being slaughtered japanese wondered where was the dive bomber and if you did not know carrier cannot launch off planes when being attacked as the wind will prevent them from flying toward the sky which is the reason why japan barely had zero refueling and the only carrier with no planes was the hiryu as yamaguchi sent his out for the american carrier, little did they know the american dive bomber was lost and needed to be refueled but they kept pushing and soon they found  the japanese flattop with plane on deck and these dauntless had 1k kg bomb that was AP (armor peircing) as they dive to the kaga akagi then soryu, flaming those ships up but the hiryu escaped without a scratch and she had her deck empty and her strike has found yorktown to avenge her sister her plane sunk the yorktown but the enterprise had a dive bomber heading toward hiryu and blasting her forward deck.  Photo of hiryu crippled was taken by the hosho pilot then they scuttle hiryu. Ships like mikuma a mogami class heavy cruiser did not survive while mogami was badly damage she survived and haruna too after being targeted many time, asashio made it which she was a asashio class destroyer.   Little did america knew that in 1942 japan was about to endangered the american carrier leaving enterprise only after the shokaku zuikaku junyo and zuiho was about to meet them in battle of santa cruz a month after the battle of the solomon island with saratoga sinking ryujo.  Anyways that is all i got to show and yes there will be spelling mistake and errors so be aware.",2,0,Jade West

This movie, appears to be a true well done tribute to that generation from what I can see in the trailer. Attention to detail was something I noticed right away..  We are losing that generation of heroes fast and this will probably be the last tribute to them ever made before they are all gone.   I don't watch movies in movie theaters because they are a rip off in cost and because I don't like not being able to defend myself.  But for this, last tribute I may very well go see this movie in theater because it is that big to all that served.",17,0,Malakie Usn
