2020-05-19T02:34:37Z,I am not familiar with the comics and am new to this film series. Does anyone know if there is going to be another movie with this cast. It seemed as though there is room and a storyline there for another movie. I am referring to Charles going to live with Eric and the others as well as Eric getting another helmet. I didn't think this movie was all that bad. I kind of enjoyed it. Glad I didn't listen to the critics. Thanks for reading.  Thank you for your time.,0,2,JG_ Soares

After Jean Grey went out of control in public, the President suddenly cuts off the direct phone line earlier established between him and Professor Xavier. 4) The villain Vuk's appearances are just about as mesmerizing as that of Justice League's Steppenwolf and Thor: The Dark World's Malekith.",0,1,Si Dunue

I think Sophie Turner would play a good role as a babysitter in a movie, shopping at the supermarket, playing with children.  a family film.

2019-06-09T22:23:06Z,"First of all, I’m pretty much aware that there are lots of bad reviews out there. I’m sure that you’ve seen them as well. The thing is, “X-Men: Dark Phoenix” is not as bad as what critics are saying. In my opinion, this film is better than “X-Men: Apocalypse” and the previous Phoenix Saga adaptation, “X-Men: The Last Stand”.  ”X-Men: Dark Phoenix” clearly shows that Sophie Turner is strong enough to carry this film, she’s amazing. Even though the script for the film is a bit generic, not to mention that there are some cringeworthy ones. The first and the second act of the film are a bit slow, however, things are getting 180° different in the third act. By different, I mean in a good way. The entire soundtrack of the film is excellent, as the entire score is composed by Hans Zimmer.  From the recurring cast, James McAvoy’s Professor X and Michael Fassbender’s Magneto got their awesome chemistry as usual. Jennifer Lawrence and Nicholas Hoult are also amazing. I can finally feel the chemistry of Tye Sheridan’s Scott with Sophie Turner’s Jean. It’s also nice knowing that Kodi Smit-McPhee’s Nightcrawler and Alexandra Shipp’s Storm finally deserve more spotlight. The newcomer Jessica Chastain, she’s good but her villain role is weak, and I’m not talking about her powers. It’s just I can’t feel her role as a villain. Here’s an advice, keep your eyes sharp to see some cameos of X-Men’s familiar mutants from the comics.  In the end, despite what the critics are saying, “X-Men: Dark Phoenix” is still quite enjoyable and entertaining. A decent way to end FOX’s X-Men franchise, kinda.  7/10  If you’re wondering for a credit scene, the answer is no, there are no mid or post credit scene for this film.  #XMen #DarkPhoenix",20,2,Cahya Nur Rahmah

For me, I think it was the ETHER ( Liquid-like form) or also most known as the REALITY STONE (solid form of Ether)  Remember Jean Grey already has the Pheonix Force way back before when they faught En Saba Nur,she used the Pheonix Force to defeat and ddestroy him.  When she absorb Ether,her powers were amplified to an uncontrollable state that's why she can't control it  For others who does not know what the term ""ETHER"" is, please watch THOR : THE DARK WORLD.  That's what I think Jean absorbed. In the movie they said it wasn't a solar flare, that they did not know that it was but some sort of unlimited energy and power.

Years ago, I was expecting there is a bad mutant who can give Jean a good fight, woman to woman. Like other mutant from Asia maybe. I wish like Lucy Liu play the role as Jean's enemy at the end of the fight, where they have same power to destroy and the fight will takes 5 to 10 minutes to end the story by the lost of both (because of their own strong power).

Rachel Summers is jean and scotts child and also the even more powerful ""White Phoenix""👑 She also became an instant omega level mutant and such. 3. YOU ALL KNOW THAT CABLE FROM DEADPOOL IS HER SON RIGHT?? ya'll know where he got his abilities, right? hence his link to the x-men😎 4. Jean was already the host or the main body for the phoenix from a young age, Charles put ""mental blocks"" up to basically help her, like mutiple personality disorder medication for mutants. Jean Grey/Marvel Girl was one personality and then the other was The Phoenix. So when the ""flare"" in space hit her it brought out the ""DARK"" side of her ""Phoenix"" personality. 👭🏻 5. ""Smith"" (Chastain) is the mental voice inside, that all personality disorders have when having a ""Pyscotic Episode"" or ""Dark"" form of a Phoenix breakdown. ""She's All Rage, She's All Pain"" (she even talks to herself knowing she has that other personality inside of her)  6.

She is not the best of actors on a good day, but having her in a starring role next to people that actually know what they are doing is only going to highlight this fact. Thankfully Game of Thrones has her in scenes that border on only a minute long. Elle Fanning, Brie Larson, Anya Taylor-Joy, Rose Leslie, Kate Mara, Karen Gillan, and Jane Levy would have all been better suited to play this role. They actually have range.",0,0,RagingRaven88

But from what I've seen in the trailer, there are a lot of similarities to what I feel with my depression. I push people away, and end up hurting them because I don't feel like I deserve their help, OR I don't want their help because I want to believe I can deal with it on my own and not drag people along with my problems.

Jean Grey as The Dark Phoenix is confident, narcissistic and cruel most of the time... Phoenix has unlimited power, she is omnipotent. Phoenix even eats entire stars... all I can see in the trailer is a weak weak weak version of Phoenix, a melodramatic Jean Grey dealing with internal problems most of the time and seems like the entire movie will be like that.  There is always a fire effect surrounding Jean Grey in the Phoenix Saga... that detail is very important to show the Phoenix power... even Captain Marvel looks more Phoenix with those effects.

2019-03-05T17:09:19Z,"legion and doom patrol ( who had a team member who has different power each personality) was a good series both are insanely good! i guess if they manage to show these characters who have multiple personalities it should be on big screen too and that would be a total challenge tho LEGION was succeaful and they pull it off even THE GIFTED series  MY POINT Is LEGION should appear very soon why only showing jean who has two identities it would be more interesting to showcase other xmen members like LEGION it would be very very very good movie if they would do it as a film as well  and am i think other interesting part of this comic series and characters are when mutants have discovered another mutant power like ot manifested when they aged and they know so much about their power and have to much experience exploring their powers like the mutants EMMA FROST  and they killed mystique  i dont really know that much about the timeline i havent seen mystique getting her wings granted by another mutant enhancement and the other like weapon x project  i was waiting for vanessa of deadpool to show her powers as well since she was known to be mutant COPYCAT speaking of copycat why they havent showned the same mutant who would be the most powerful mutant of still alive mutant SYNCH same powers like copycat tho he was killed on comic series but still deserve to be seen on big screen of be seen on tv series  like they everything they do was wrong  legion must be a movie instead of being just a series why? is it about the fund or the team and script they need to deal with?  marketing and strategically speaking to make more money out of this comic series well they should have showcase every mutant not just cameos ! come on! they have been focusing on main cast of xmen there are other interesting villain and heroes in fact there are so many mutant which is more than the numbers of characters than the rest of marvel universe characters  and then if these will be casted and get it done timelines of this comic series will be easier to guess who actually died or never exist anymore in this mutant series  plus! if they would think about showing every mutant come on! you let the xmen fans so happy and proud showing all the mutant which if was made of course many fans will watch this and definitely making more money  so think this through FOX DISNEY AND MARVEL team this would be the best suggestion you would ever hear from a fan like me im sure i am not alone who come up with this idea and some already made the comment pointing to these ideas  retelling the story that is fine but you would suffer on the budget yet you still get reinbursed because of so many fans waiting for these to be seen plus the idea of making super cut movie like once upon a deadpool rated pg 13  why dont you make the uncensored and come up with the idea removing the not appropriate things that should not be seen by minors like you guys did to once upon a deadpool  make more series and movies showing all the mutant that might cause you a lot of money that soon will reinbursed you triple time than the budget you have spent  and dont mind the DISNEY rules protecting the child and do work with the rated pg version of the movie or series  not just triple but a big blow back of reinbursement i mean come on if you are having problem with the script hire more but i still suggest it should stil have inspiring scripts ans heartful messages from the characters which by the way i havent read the complete comic series but im pretty sure its not a problem to work of focus on im sure the comic itself says already good things and some finishing touch to the original script itself from the comics i cant even stand the problem of making the title? come on guys?! why not stick with the title lf the original comic series where they are getting it to begin with, they are just making alive the comic series on big screen why struggling with the title?  any who agrees with this idea?",0,0,Lee Angelo Matthew

I have no interest in these younger version(actors) of cyclops, jean, storm, etc. Only fassbender, mccavoy are worth transitioning to the MCU.

Am I supposed to just suspend disbelief and we just all pretend that that James McAvoy ages so dramatically he becomes Sir Patrick in less than 10 years etc? Or? I really want them to come full circle and make a 2003 movie again and try to nonsensically tie everything in all timelines together. For my own closure with or without Wolverine....,1,0,Dehinina

2019-03-03T11:33:41Z,"Here's what I expect the film to deliver: 1. Tell the story of the phoenix in a reasonable fashion, about how it started out, and how it developed inside of Jean, along with what Professor X did and should've done instead. 2. Tell us what happens between ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" and ""Logan"". We all saw the last of the X-Men at the end of ""Days of Future Past"", and then the last of leftover X-Men in ""Deadpool 2"", but no proper explanation for the absence of most of the important characters, or a proper send-off. 3. Execute a perfect ending to this whole X-Men universe by finishing leftover character arcs and making sure everyone finds a suitable ending. 4. Fill up the void about some important characters that could've been otherwise depicted better but weren't, like Victor Creed, Sunspot, Bishop, maybe make a reference to the Fantastic Four existing in their universe now that it's all about to end anyway. That last bit would blow my mind.",16,4,C W

Those dampener collars look familiar, are they being taken to the Icebox prison? I love the new timeline after DOFP, Apocalypse, Deadpool 1&2, and now this one (Yes, I said it, Deadpool 1&2 are set before Dark Phoenix. It makes sense. I know some people think that movies take place on the real life year they are released, which is stupid, but hey!) And no, it doesn´t look like anything remotely close to X3. People (MCU fans mostly) need to stop bringing that movie up, like everything about X-men reminds them of X3 now. Stop it! If you don´t like this, it´s ok, but stop mimicking everything you hear just for the sake of your desire to see the X-men on a universe that never said the word mutant at all, whatsoever..... (we´ll see how the hell they are going to translate into that universe what it means to be a mutant hero on a world that fears and hates them). They didn´t have mutants before, even though two of them were already there, two of the most famous sons of you know who mutants, one supposedly so fast he ended up dying for not being fast enough......MCU X-meh!",0,0,Sheila Cruz

2019-03-01T07:16:13Z,I just feel done. I wish that they stopped after Days Of Future Past. It’s one thing to wipe away previous continuity in favor of something better but Apocalypse was pretty mediocre. Dark Phoenix has been through so many delays and reshoots that I’m expecting a mess. Also I’m so tired of this version of Mystique. What a butchery of the character Lawrence’s take has been. I know it’s not her fault as much as these suites that decided just to make her a mutant version of Katnis to appeal to her Hunger Games fan base. They should have had faith in Lawrence to play a villain.,0,0,Review Of The NERDS

Hopefully they stay true to the comics and i hope it is nowhere near the last stand (that was a disappointing x-men film despite how good the actos/actresses were, it was the direction of the storyline). I just don't understand why it is so difficult for them to actually create the costumes that resembles the x men...where is Phoenix's green and gold costume? Wolverine, rogue, and gambit played a critical role in the Phoenix saga. Where are they? Where's the Shi'Er empire? The inner circle that manipulated Jean into caving in to her dark Phoenix form? Whatever character Jessica Chastain is playing (they say it's a shapeshiftimg extraterrestrial alien) seems to be the one manipulating jean to embrace the Phoenix's powers but in the comics, Lilandra and the Shi'Er empire oppposed Jean as the phoenix and the phoenix force itself. They did not manipulate her, it was the inner circle. I really do hope this film is not a flop....",0,0,Chen Vang

Hopefully, now that Xmen can be used in the MCU, they'll actually make a good Phoenix movie after this trainwreck.  Optimists: Maybe it's just a badly edited trailer? Most of the movies in the ""First Class"" franchise have been good.  Almost everyone: Sorry but no amount of editing can make this movie look good.  Besides, Sophie Turner is a terrible Jean Grey. *Second Dark Phoenix trailer comes out*  Almost everyone: Oh my God this looks so good, I can't wait to see it.",4,0,Intactbjörn

The 3 actors I've mentioned are the main ones you think of and none of them are in it. But the main thing that annoys me is the timeline, did they ever explain how Jean is like this 20 years before the originals, first time we meet her she praises the professor as his power is amazing compared to hers and now she has the power of a god 20 years ago or they ran out of material they wanted to use and just used the best one that would get fans excited.

Everybody knows that the only reason she got picked to play Jean Grey, was because she was on Game of Thrones. For some reason is the X men is obsessed with Game of Thrones since it has like 10 actors from Game of Thrones on its movie series. And to be honest it was a mistake to cast Sophia Turner as Jean grey because she doesn’t look like jean grey and she’s just a bad actress. Sure she’s not bad when playing a boring character but she’s playing Jean grey. They only picked her because she was on game of thrones to attract more audience. At least pick Jon snows girlfriend because she at least looked more like Jean grey and had more personality. And her American accent is terrible.

2019-02-28T17:10:50Z,"I am a huge Fox X-Men film fan, but I always felt like the narrative concluded with Logan. I was hoping I was wrong since this film fits in before Logan, but because of Days of Future Past, we know that the only characters at risk are Magneto, Mystique, Nightcrawler, and Quicksilver, the rest, including Jean, will be fine in the end. I was not a huge fan of Sophie Turner being cast as Jean since she felt mean and cold in the last film and this continues to prove I was right about her lack of on screen warmth to care enough for the character. I always felt that Jennifer Lawrence and Sophie Turner were two of the weakest links in this series, and yet they focus so strongly on them, which is a mistake. The focus should be on Cyclops and Jean completely for this film. That is where X3 went wrong (of many places) and that's where this is going wrong. But it's the end of the Fox X-Men films so it's not a big deal that this trailer doesn't look too promising to be a great conclusion. I can rest easy knowing it just fits in between Apocalypse and the end of Days of Future Past and Logan. So for me it's more filler. Seeing Hugh Jackman show up (which will never happen) again would probably be a very pleasant surprise in this....but ain't gonna happen, I know. It's really a film series focused on his character.",0,0,Erik Wegner

Will Magneto kills millions again and be forgiven as usual? Fox, do you want to make a good X-Men movie? Then forget about Mystique, mutant prejudice and Magneto/Xavier romance. You’ve drained too much out of it already. X-Men is much more than that. Just keep to Claremont/Cockrum/Byrne/Smith era. Don’t go beyond it. Make a first movie that looks like the first Avengers, but with smaller scope (no pointless destruction of entire cities), then a second movie like Guardians of the Galaxy, and the third movie can be whatever you want, if you’ve done the first two right.

Some of my favorite movies were done by this studio and seeing it disappear and almost all of it's licenses go to Disney is heartwrenching.   I don't hate everything Disney does but the tone is almost always the same and you don't get certain films from them because they're too adult. They take little to no risks and everything feels repetitive and formulaic. Gotta hand it to them tho, the audience loves the formula so much that almost everything they make being good or terrible is going to make money.  Still, I feel that 10 years from now we will look back and think ""this factory made movies that we have now have lost so much heart and creativity that I wish the buyout never happened""",0,0,MaulSlasher

Film: This is also a movie about someone you love that did something wrong. Would you stand by them or would you ostracize them? It is also about addiction. These things have always been an issue throughout time. I think these are more important things for young and old to think about today than trying to get people united against white people who happen to be men. {Shameful and disgusting} FOX is class all the way!

2019-02-28T08:14:13Z,Honestly there are some cool shots in this trailer but I'm still not gonna go and pay to see this. It still has some similar story beats to X3. Also the trailer is trying to tell us that the Phoenix bonded with Jean during a mission in space. How is that possible when Jean is already bonded with the Phoenix and she never even went to space prior to this movie? They even showed it in Apocalypse. She used its power to destroy Apocalypse. So why didn't she start to lose control of her powers then? Even just a little.  Then a few months maybe even a year or more later the X-Men have a mission in Space and then she bonds with Phoenix force? Even though she already is? Then loses control of her powers NOW and then turns bad... WHAT!!!!!?????? That makes no sense at all.,0,0,Darth Adonut

I mean, I really like Last Stand to begin with, but the fact that certain visuals are similar to how they are in that movie, shows some real consistency. Like, history is repeating itself, or playing out the same way. It sort of shows the dangers of time travel, Wolverine went back in time to save the future, but in doing so, the timeline was affected severely, as in Phoenix being awakened much sooner due to what ever happened on that space mission. But even so, events are playing out similar, recognize the street from the beginning of the trailer, how about the shot of Scott confronting a full on Dark Phoenix Jean, calling her name, where have we seen something like that before. None of this I see as negative, it's interesting to see and might actually help the credibility of Last Stand, seeing and alternate version of that movies events.",0,0,Commander Karl

Brie Larsen should study this.  I hope Marvel does not decide to throw away the GOOD comic book movies like X Men and Jean Grey -- and replace them with their social justice garbage like Ms Marvel and Squirrel Girl.

2019-02-28T05:32:43Z,Chastain has to be Lilandra. They could have done a gladiatorial style battle like X-Men: The Animated Series between the X-Men and Shi'ar with Gladiator's team vs. X-Men where if Shi'ar wins they destroy Jean Grey/Dark Phoenix and if the X-Men win then the Shi'ar will have to leave earth and can't hurt Jean Grey.,105,19,Raghu Seetharaman
