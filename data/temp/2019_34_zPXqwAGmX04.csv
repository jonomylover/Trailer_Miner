To me this will beat any other movie in the category of poop movie. USA movies are getting worse and worse. Getting something for the whole family without profanity or a trashy language is now almost impossible. Even things for fairy tales are getting destroy and use to promote gays and some ideologies and something that gets my attention is how most of the time the  couples are black and white. Why that?. I'm not racist but is really out of the limit. Now is boring to see them in all movies. As is a racist agenda against white race. Is really stupid, Sad and frustrating how everyday our kids are getting attack by the media who are using all they can to make their sicks mind to be expand to everyone.

It's NOT okay that 11 years old KIDS have contact with sexual toys. It's NOT okay they're making fun of it. It's NOT okay AT ALL. It's so freacking obvious why this movie is so wrong in so MANY ways. ""It's just a movie"" IS NOT a valid argument. Child actors should play CHILD ROLES. ""If you don't like it, don't watch it"" so you're telling me I shouldn't do shit about child sexual abuse, that I should just turn my head and do nothing? That's the same reason why are many PEDOPHILES producing shows for Nickelodeon, Disney, CN, etc.  Ask any parent or reasonable adult and they would tell you why this movie or this single idea is so fucked up and PLEASE search the meaning of ""sexual abuse"".

I couldn’t even hear myself listening while they were laughing, it was so annoying that we almost got kicked out or everyone told us to be quiet.

Obviously, it’s very exaggerated, but for one, most of the bad things that happen in the movie are in the trailer, and at the movie’s heart, it’s a coming of age story. I’m guessing that most of the people who are complaining about the movie didn’t actually see it, because contrary to how the trailer makes it seem, the movie isn’t just about kids doing bad things. In my opinion, I think that it’s worse to pretend that kids are innocent little angels instead of people who are starting to learn about more mature things in the world, because then the kids can make the right decisions about these more mature things, instead of hiding it and making bad decisions.",2,0,Electricprimate

2019-08-26T02:50:15Z,"The TRUTH about this movie: First of all, these hardcore christian conservative types will hate everything that isn't wholesome and will judge the movie without even seeing it.  Ignore them.  The movie is about tweens tryjng to figure out the world. The movie portrays them as innocent, ignorant, and immature as kids that age normally are.  They are not sexualize, but instead are exhibited to be clueless about sex and adult situations, which is also normal.  There is no references of kids wanting to have sex, just wating to kiss.  The main  point of the movie is actually the value of friendship and how people grow apart in life.  It has a message about how we as human beings change and our varying interest and personalities eventually collide.  There is actually a life lesson about being yourself, and that friendships can always remain even when you meet different/new people.  The profanity aspect of the movie is not so much different from tweens of today, except they obviously exaggerated it.",5,1,jaydel3

2019-08-24T11:11:54Z,"I saw this movie yesterday. I’m not going to lie some of it was really funny. My friends and I could relate to lots of the times when the kids freaked out, like when they crossed the highway we thought that was like us crossing at school. However lots of it was weird. Like lots of it seemed like it was for 6th graders, like the messages about friendship. The bit that I didn’t like the most though was when they go to the frat house to buy Molly. It wasn’t even the fact they were buying drugs because it is just a movie, it was the fact that there was lots of rape references, weird sorority initiation things going on and lots of dodgy men.  It just wasn’t funny to see children in that environment.  We all got ID’d to see the film even though we’re 16. My friend almost didn’t get in because she didn’t have any on her but we left and came back and someone else let us in without ID. Even though the movie has 12 year olds as the leads.  As we left lots of people said the movie was shit and I can understand why. When you’re 16/17 you don’t want to see 12 year olds crying about friendship.  I truly have no idea who the target audience is. It should be mid teens but the film is weirdly young at parts. It does deal with important issues like divorce but not very well to be honest.  Overall I did like the movie but I wouldn’t see it again any time soon. Some moments were hilarious but that’s only really because my friends and I could tag ourselves. I don’t think they’d be that funny if we couldn’t.",1,1,Sofia Coia

So, rated R for language.  Besides kissing, there are no ""sexual situations"" besides a few kisses, however, there are a ton of sex toys that are totally innocently used, as those are completely misused, as their true nature is completely unknown to the kids, which ads tremendously to the hilarity of the situations.

Don't know if its intentional but someone pointed it out. We already know adolescent boys are like this why does there need to be a movie about it. That's boring.

How is this movie not generating a ton of controversy?! I feel bad for those kids being ruined and exploited by this movie and their parents. I didn't go through any of this when I was their age! I didn't know anything dirty at their age. Nothing! I still don't understand most of the jokes. I don't get the line ""How many husbands does she have?!"" What the fuck does that mean? What's she having a threesome? What the fuck is a kissing party? That's not a thing. What the fuck are anal beads for? What's the mask for? What are the other ""weapons""? What the fuck is Molly? What the fuck is a nymphomaniac? What the fuck is the indoor swing? What's it called? What's it for? This movie is appalling and despicable! If society didn't make sex and sexuality taboo and shelter kids from things, maybe I wouldn't get pissed off at movies like this. Or maybe I still would. I don't know. But I don't like mixed messages. I can't live in a society that makes everything related to sex off-limits to kids and be okay with movies like Good Boys. It has to be on or the other.

2019-08-01T18:43:32Z,"So many comments from people about how horrible this is. Labeling the people who liked the trailer as pedophiles? Really? Saying it shouldn't be available at theaters? What the? I see many people are all about censorship. We have freedoms here in the U.S. Some commenters may live in other countries where they don't have freedom of choice, but here in the U.S. a person can make a personal decision as to whether or not to watch a movie, read a book, or go to an event. In other countries the rights of people are suppressed. If you want that, I recommend you move to one of them or stay there if already in one. I personally don't like seeing (and thus avoid) the nude bicyclist events in multiple cities throughout the U.S., but since it's labeled as ""progressive"" those events are not only occurring, they are endorsed by the media and politicians. Somehow seeing a grown man with his appendage waving around is okay, but a movie with kids swearing and acting like most pre-teen boys is offensive? For those people who say their kid doesn't act like that, you'd be shocked. Take the rose colored glasses off. The good thing is that most of these kids grow up to be people who love their families, treat people with respect, work for a living, and have good hearts.",0,0,Cindy O

Even though the kids are in adult situations, (which is what’s funny) this movie clearly shows their innocence in those situations. Hormones, puberty, moving from your family to your friend group... it’s an amazingly complicated and comic time of life. I don’t see anything wrong with it. It’s not like these kids are being led down a dark path... these things are around us all the time and all kids go through a period of learning about adult things and deciding who they want to be.

Dancing with the stars; kids"" ""kid master chef"" and those aweful pageant or dancing shows. When you wake up out of this satanic and vile matrix of an illusory reality you can see through this so called entertainment for what it is and it is PROPAGANDA and cultural conditioning.

Hollywood is a means of socially conditioning people to accept evil as being funny and good.   But Hollywood also rubs the truth in your face sometimes:  “It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. You are a slave; like everyone else, you were born into bondage.
