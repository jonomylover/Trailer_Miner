2020-05-26T16:19:58Z,Great movie. Has great acting and presentation elements than fast and furious series combined. The ending was heartful. Christian Bale everytime amazes the audience. His whole persona is like he becomes the character. One can really forget that the same guy played Bruce Wayne. It's exhilarating. It's thrilling and it's how real talent are whitewashed from achievement boards created by people who don't have a clue what real passion is. 7000RPM. Matt Damon was also upto his mark.,0,0,Ritu Raj

He made them what they are. Kudos to Ford Performance on their newer performance Shelby cars. It’s like they sent the cars to Munich or Stuttgart and told them to make it right, then send it back. Directly speaking for the Shelby Cobra R which we will have some VIR Full Course Laps as soon as the track opens back up and compare it to the BMW M4 GTS. (:",0,0,Carmine’s Import Service

Chris Amon happened to be one of my favourite drivers from that period, although he never had much luck in F1. He won the race in 1966, with Bruce McLaren, but seems to be way down the credits list. I think reading the actual history of the GT40 development would be more interesting than this film, which looks like a Stars and Stripes wank-fest.",0,0,Russell Parratt

2020-01-17T00:13:15Z,Why are people making this movie about Ford? This movie isn't about ford y'all stop being a fangirl this movie is about a great guy that we have lost a few years back an American hero name Carroll Shelby. Stop being a brainless fangirl y'all missing the whole point of this movie. Mopar or Chevy could have easily done the same had they went to him first. So shut the fn up about Ford geeeshhh.... They just named the movie Ford vs Ferrari becuse those are more commonly know to everyone basecally Hollywood promo if they had named the movie Carroll Shelby then only car guys would know.

Absolutely unlikely the reconstruction of how things went between Henry Ford and Enzo Ferrari, with the Drake reduced to an insulting and offending Ford Jr. 'guilty' of having offered him a mountain of dollars while he is close to economic collapse. A Ferrari that is then represented (not bad, by Remo Girone) in the stands of Le Mans '66 when even the stones know that Enzo Ferrari at the time was not going to the races for quite a while. Not to mention the caricature that Franco Gozzi and Carol Shelby would like to portray ... As if that were not enough, there is also the unfortunate reconstruction of the ‘theater of war’, Le Mans, just as the reproductions of the real racing cars used for shooting on the track are absolutely unlikely.

2019-10-13T11:52:15Z,"Oggi è il 6 febbraio e ricorre l’anniversario della schiacciante vittoria delle Ferrari, contro le Ford, a Daytona in Florida. Un’immagine che farà il giro del mondo e rimarrà negli annali come la sconfitta del colosso americano Ford da parte della Ferrari: uno di quei momenti che hanno fatto diventare la Ferrari un’icona dello sport motoristico mondiale.    Daytona 1967 -2    Tra Ferrari e Ford è in corso da due stagioni un vero e proprio scontro sportivo, e la Ford nel 1966 vince a Le Mans, con un arrivo in parata, riuscendo finalmente a conquistare le prime pagine dei giornali. Per Enzo Ferrari è un grosso smacco, anche perché la stagione sportiva delle vetture di Maranello è complicata, problemi sia in F.1 che con le vetture sport.    Ma nel 1967 la Ferrari sviluppa la nuova 330P4, equipaggiandola con il V 12 di 4 litri a tre valvole per cilindro e con il cambio progettato e realizzato dalla Ferrari stessa. Alcune P3, utilizzate nella stagione precedente, vengono ammodernate con la nuova aerodinamica della P4 e vengono affidate alle scuderie private. Ulteriore cambio di passo a Maranello e l’incarico a Franco Lini, grande giornalista sportivo e gran interprete dei regolamenti sportivi, del ruolo di Direttore Sportivo.    La 24 ore di Daytona ha inizio e subito per le vetture di Detroit le cose si mettono male: le GT40 si rompono e dopo appena due ore di gara la Ferrari si trova senza il suo più accreditato rivale.    Le vetture di Maranello continuano la gara inanellando sorpassi, per nulla impensierite dagli avversari, ed una volta arrivate al comando, continuano indisturbate fino al traguardo.    Ma poco prima della fine della gara ecco la genialata del nuovo DS. Franco Lini, per vivacizzare la monotonia della gara, ha una intuizione e, da buon ex giornalista, organizza un arrivo in parata delle tre Ferrari per la gioia degli spettatori presenti. Tra gli intenti della Ferrari c’è quello di rivendicare l’arrivo in parata delle Ford a Le Mans dell’anno prima. Tagliare quel traguardo con tre Ferrari appaiate è un grande smacco per l’industria automobilistica americana.    Davide sconfigge Golia, in casa sua.    Quell’arrivo in parata è rimasto nella storia dell’automobilismo sportivo. Chris Amon e Lorenzo Bandini sono i vincitori e la loro vettura è affiancata dalla P4 di Mike Parkes e Ludovico Scarfiotti, seconda e dalla 412P NART di Pedro Rodriguez e Jean Guichet.    L’industria europea ha sconfitto, in casa, il colosso statunitense ed il pubblico di Daytona applaude alla schiacciante vittoria.

The dealer tells him, I carry both the 289 and the 427 but I'd advise you to try the 289 as it's much easier to drive for most people. No says the guy, I gotta have the 427. The dealer gets the keys and they walk out to a beautiful white with blue stripes, Cobra roadster. They get in and the guy drives it a few miles, accelerating wildly and almost losing control a few times. They return to the dealership, the guy is sweating and a little shaken. He says, you're right, maybe I should try the 289 to which the dealer replies, that was the 289.",290,8,triggernutsy1

And not just so we could talk about it when we’re doing press, but because it actually makes a physical difference when you see it on screen.”",50,0,Kevin Black

2019-06-10T22:28:04Z,"I think people forget that Shelby beat Ferrari 3 times before the GT40 in 66.  In 59, Shelby won the 24 hours of LeMans as a driver for Aston Martin and then for two years before the GT40 from 64 to 65 with the Daytona Coupe.  Although Ferrari got the title in 64 because Enzo cancelled the last race (he had the clout and he had the FIA in his backpocket) so Shelby couldn't take the championship...but in my books, Enzo got scared and wimped out.  However, in 65, with Bondurant and Gurney at the wheel, they spanked Ferrari and won their class and took the championship including the 24 of LeMans.  Ken Miles was Shelby's tester for the 63 Cobra and then became his top driver thereafter. Also, I think Damon is the worst choice to play Shelby.  Shelby is over 6 feet tall and Damon is just a tiny speck of dust compared to Shelby.  Bale has some resemblance to Miles but Damon looks way out of place.  And for those who think Ford was behind Shelby's car...you couldn't be further from the truth.  Shelby went to see Ed Cole at ""GM"" first but he wouldn't give him an engine because GM didn't want competition for the Corvette.  So image if GM had given Shelby his engine.

It's a 7 litre engine in the same class as a car with a 4 litre engine, pretty obvious who has the advantage. If you think about it objectively, if the Ferrari's V12 was 7 litres and the GT40's V8 engine was 4 litres, it's pretty obvious who would win.

2019-06-04T18:29:55Z,"I had extremely high hopes for this movie, and to be straight up forward i don’t think Matt Damon is suited for this movie. He just doesn’t fit the part and does not look like Carroll Shelby. And Jon Bernthal is not even CLOSE to Lee Lacocca! Again the part doesn’t fit him. This has an opportunity of become an amazing Movie!! There’s so much!!  Christian Bale is the only one that sort of fits his Ken Miles character. Don’t get your hope to high. I feel like after watching the movie, if you’re really a car enthusiast and know the history well, than you will be pretty unsatisfied with it.

2019-06-03T21:30:54Z,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SMQHL83 The Ten, will be on Amazon for free until Thursday.   The Ten, is a futuristic short story that revolves around heroes whose spirits are connected to the mightiest entities to ever exist; in order to save the Human Realm from an extra dimensional fugitive with incredible power, ten individuals must merge with the Soul Arms, which will grant them the ability to access the might of their Spirit Guardian's former incarnation.   The story begins by describing Patrick's journey, which begins with his criminal life. While traveling undercover with a biker gang, he accidentally ends up in a strange land; within it, he stumbles across a mystic weapon. The spirits attached to it inform Patrick of his bizarre destiny, which can only be fulfilled if he uses his newfound power to save the undead elders' descendants.   Part 2 follows a king named Kalga, who rules over an isolated tribe within a galaxy that's distant from Earth's. When a royal blacksmith's stock is stolen by mindless-ravenous creatures, he kidnaps the only person that can help him; by arming Kalga with his destined Soul Arm, he's made ready to recover the creations from the magic-infused monsters.",0,0,A L

2019-06-03T09:57:33Z,I’m a big big fan love the ford GT 40 MK and 2005 - 2007 one as well cause what mad the GT was the V8 now back in 2017 I feel like they spat on  Shelby grave by putting a V6 in it yes it makes more BHP but it loses its heart they took out the V6 for the V8 cause it was less strain on the engines to keep up with the V6 Ferrari’s. It’s a race see who’s better the British - New Zealand - America vs Italy ford vs Ferrari ford GT40 designed based on the British lola mk6 and built in the UK with Shelby’s V8 and New Zealand racers to take the win. 🇬🇧🇺🇸🇳🇿 VS 🇮🇹.  🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁,0,0,faron tilley

2019-06-03T02:03:19Z,"Looks like an epic film.  Important to note Ken Miles was leading the 1966 Le Mans race but near the end, in then typical Ford corporate think, the brass wanted the 3 leading Fords to slow down and cross the finish line 3 abreast.  This caused Miles to not win the race because the French race officials, in their infinite wisdom, said the 2nd place Ford, having started further behind, had been driven more miles and should win the race.  This deprived Ken Miles of his first Le Mans win and the triple crown (Daytona, Sebring, Le Mans) of Endurance racing.  Sadly, Ken Miles was killed while testing the prototype Ford J-Car at Riverside International Raceway just 2 months later.  The J-Car would be heavily modified into the the Ford GT-40 Mk. IV which won the only two races it was entered in, the Sebring 12 hours and the Le Mans 24 Hour races of 1967.",0,1,Bart Y
