2019-12-23T03:01:49Z,"Look all things considered maybe it wasn’t a good movie, but it’s sure better than real life. Don’t look at it as a production, a job or an artwork or some crap like that. Just watch it. Don’t ask questions, because just like in real life, you won’t get the answers you want. Escape from reality for just a little while, and invest yourself into the character’s lives, understand the way they feel. Which isn’t hard, by the way The way Yii feels, how she always keeps busy, it makes total sense. She’s the type of person who hides their pain. When her father died, she was sad. She said she didn’t cry, but you know you miss them when you can’t cry, in a way. She started doing jobs around the neighborhood, and she cut herself off from her family because she didn’t want to expose that pain.  I wouldn’t be surprised if she was dealing with depression of some sort, and her keeping busy was her way of detaching herself, cutting all ties to avoid that mental pain.",0,0,Mentally Stable Is Fake

2019-12-04T11:48:17Z,wouldn't it be more efficient to show it on the news and on live television ask the government to protect this insanely rare creature? I'm pretty sure some private research facility with a few billion worth of assets can't match the country they work under and the people globally joining to help them.

Still, I don’t think we can just deem the movie to be a supporter of this nine dash line controversy, for all we know maybe the producers just didn’t know about this and referenced something off from Google. Its like how I would assume my Caucasian friends to know where Singapore is, a lot of them still ask me which part of China that is, so...🤷🏻‍♀️  So let’s give them the benefit of doubt and not grill them too much?

But the characters look nice, the yeti is freaking adorable. I think I’ll see this, but it might have to convince me a little more first, seeing that we a,ready know the plot. And since this is from the creators of HTTYD, we can imagine that the yeti gets stolen by the bad people. The girl goes through a moment of weakness, her friends are there to cheer her up and she then regains her confidence. They go through an epic battle to rescue the yeti, they get the yeti back. And return it to its home which will no doubt make you cry. Because of all they’ve been through. But still looks cute, there’s a good chance that I’ll watch it.
