Even the trailer is better: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0V8ZJ_8qARs The problem with American versions is they never acknowledge the original upfront, they are star-driven too, not story-driven and they are mawkish in their sentimentality. Somehow the European versions are always more real. Not that this US version won't be ok and I'll say some of my favourite movies are American independent films. It's just the gross Hollywood over-lay to a French modern classic that may be hard to swallow. Also, Kevin Hart is deliberately (mis)cast here as a career move for him (I can hear the agents doing the pitch) so he does a more serious role with some slapstick and goofiness thrown in.",0,0,walter&bruges

2019-04-26T16:06:16Z,"Just for everyone's information, this real-life story happened in the 90's and has been published in 2001 in the real Philippe's autobiography. So any resemblance to any movie is just a coincidence, or maybe due to the fact that it's a universal subject that touches people's heart. The movie is called ""Untouchable"" in the UK, so it's not a misspelling.  Like many people here, it hurts my eyes to see a remake of it, and it's actually the 4th one already (2 indians and 1 Argentinian came before this one).  1. The original movie, softened for wider audiences, is still a lot closer to the original story in tone and in spirit than any others. It feels a lot more authentic. 2. The actors are the best that could be found for these roles. François Cluzet's acting is so spot on, the handicap, the pain, the limited facial expressions that convey a lot more emotions that any body movement could ever express. And, of course, there is so much to say about Omar Sy, his charisma, his playfulness, his emotion in the dramatic parts of the movie, his comedic intuition, the life and joy that emanate from him... 3. The humor is not heavy and forced like we can see in this trailer, there is still place for real deep attachment to the characters and empathy for their situations, the ellipses give some elegance to both their conditions without showing or dramatizing too much. For those who talked about stereotyping and racist depiction of social classes, the real-life caregiver had a past and a personality a lot tougher than Driss' in the French movie. Again, the American version feels so cheesy... even Nicole Kidman, an actress I admire a lot, don't give the right vibe for her role, she too should be tougher. 4. Pozzo di Borgo refused many times to have his story adapted to the screen, when the French directors of ""Intouchables"" went to see him, he told them that he would accept only if it was a comedy. And he really loved the result in that movie and all the positive repercussions it brought afterwards! Here's the real-life Philippe! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY0JIIKn660",0,0,ǝsnǝʇɐɯ-ʇos-uoɔ

In France the Blacks are pretty recent arrivals, maybe one or two generations only. So there is still a big cultural gap between French and Africans.

Bryan Cranston is brilliant and doing the best he can with two stale co-stars. I loved The Intouchables, French original. Perfect casting. Dell should have been a 20-something black or urban kid, underdog with a spark of potential, not 40-something middle aged loud-mouth lazy black dude from the projects (in NYC, really?). And the female assistant should have been younger and perkier -- a sexy poker-faced Puerto Rican or red head who mind f*cks Dell (a sexy secretary).

2018-12-15T00:55:41Z,"Let's recap shall we?    original - Bienvenue Chez les Ch'tis (2008), the highest grossing French film of all time!  remake - New In Town (2009), completely missed the plot and made it a love story rather than an insightful comedy.    original - Le Dîner de Cons (1998), hilarious French comedy.  remake - Dinner for Schmucks (2010), cheap laughs and an over the top premise.    original - Intouchables (2011), an amazingly spectacular work of art!  remake - The Upside (2019), what I can only assume will be a giant turd smear over what was originally a brilliant gem of a film.    Reasons why this film will hopefully fail:  - Hopefully the American audience won't care enough to go see it anyways.  - The original faced backlash for the 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' racial undertones when it first came out back in 2011. What do you think the American public and critics are going to say about it now!  - It won't have Ludovico Einaudi's soundtrack  - It will go for cheap laughs similar to poop and pee jokes in modern trashy comedies (already saw a few in the trailer).  - It won't have the heart and real connection between the leads that you sincerely feel in the original.  - Did I previously mention Hollywood's fails in this department in the past?    Just face it Hollywood! Trying to remake American versions of successful foreign movies is just not a good idea! Let good movies just be good movies! Let's just be honest here Hollywood, you're out of good ideas. Just go poop out another rom/com or bloated superhero franchise. Stop crapping all over everyone else's art!",3,1,Chris West

Every country does it and sometimes we gladly accept and favor the re-make over the original.   The story was so moving that i can understand how any country would like to take it, make it its own and give it to their own people-sharing culture- to empathize.  We had the first version, the film got recognition and because you love it, accept the re-make as what it is: a re-make. But for some people, the remake is the only version that they know and it's why a remake is worthy, it reaches to where the original couldn't.
