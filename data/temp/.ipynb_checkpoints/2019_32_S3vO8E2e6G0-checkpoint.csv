2020-05-30T02:53:31Z,"My first crush. I was 10 years old, living in Las Vegas with my younger sister, parents just divorced.   I was a very Sensitive , but strong will Aries child. Running the strip,  from pool to pool. Living at the lone palm motel. It was the time of my life. My first barbie, wasn't much a doll girl, though I did love sparkles! Loved playing in the desert with the trailer park kids in the early 70's! Mom let us run wild.  I remember the first time someone showed me the album by Elton John. It was too kool, ""Goodbye yellow brick road "" me, being a huge fan of ""the wizard of oz"" I used to make people call me ""Dorothy "" after ""Dorothy Gail"" I was glued to that album cover. It's one of my very first memories after my parents divorce. Then I heard it. That was the best summer of my life. I even learn to swim, saved a kid from drowning too. (Self taught swimmer) Elton and Bernies music got me through the hardest times in my life. I will be forever grateful. Now, seeing this movie, makes me love him that much more. Ny favorite scene had to be the one starting at the troubadour.  We had moved from California in 74 to vegas, so that place that ride down sunset will always be in my mind. The 70s were a different time. I'm so glad  to be a kid in the 70s. A KID not a teen. A kid! The best time of your life. This movie, brought me back. And I'm loving it over and over again.  Thank you Elton and Bernie. Thank you Taron Egerton!  You played him so well, I remember why I had a crush on him when I was a young girl . Elton was and still is captain fantastic! You did an excellent job. 💋😍",0,0,Ashley Breaux

2020-01-19T15:08:53Z,If you can get through the first 15 minutes then most of the film afterwards is worth seeing. The main issue In had with it is it doesn't know what it wants to be-- a musical fantasy or a true biopic. So they just go back and forth between both formats which doesn't really work. I thought the biopic part was well done; I had the advantage of watching on DVD so I can skip past the cringeworthy moments: Elton's trysts and the musical fantasy stuff. I.e. once you get past the pathetic scene where every family member sings a part you'll be okay.,0,2,S. Adam Bernstein

As a heterosexual, this totally grosses me out, so I chose not to see it.  Too bad that the gay population has more power in society than the 98% hetero population.  It's time we sent a message to Hollywood that we will not watch your movies and t.v. shows if they contain unnecessary gay make-out scenes, or characters in t.v. shows who ridiculously ""turn"" gay after the first season.

2019-09-03T03:26:24Z,"Disappointed. Not a bad movie..but not that good. I love ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", but Rocketman, not so much.BR worked because it focused on telling a story. Rocketman is a very bad musical. A good musical use songs to tell a story. Rocketman take all of John's hits....and throw them all over the movie. So as they are telling a story, you're taken away to a music video, back to story, then to a music video. Bohemian worked because you didn't have to be a Queen fan. You're not constantly bombarded by full queen songs in the movie and when they do, it's in the background. Rocketman bombards you with full songs and could only be a good thing if you're a John fan. Straight out of Compton was great...but imagine if every 5-10 minutes, you have to listen to a full NWA song? It would make the film horrible.  Rocketman is a lot like Beavis and Butthead where you're taking away from the story to watch dumb music videos. Horrible!",0,0,Ne Ws

I was esp Heart Broken for the way his Family treated him but was really Happy for him turning his life around and getting Sober! I really hope Taron gets an Oscar for his Protrayal of Sir Elton John because He was sooo Amazing! And Omg His Voice is sooo Beautiful and Mesmerizing! They definitely got it right when they Picked Taron to Play Sir Elton John! Now I wish Bohamian Rhapsody would be done again but with someone singing all the Songs and not Lip Syncing them! That Mark Guy sounds just like Freddie Mercury soo I say lets do a  Do Over and let him sing all the Songs this time! But as For Rocketman You need to see it if You Haven't! You definitely won't regret it! I'm an Old Soul with Sir Elton Johns Music! I just love how Raw and Real the  Songs are and that You can feel his Emotion through every single one of his Songs!

Is this movie really that way for *_the entire film?_* I can't bear to hear the music butchered, but have been a fan since 1976, so I'll prob watch just to see how much they changed the actuall story to fit the film.

2019-06-13T15:45:45Z,"Be warned: This is a homosexual musical, wrapped beautifully in poetic cinematic genius.  It sadly contains both heterosexual and homosexual soft porn scenes* (that make me once again long for  the 40s and 50s cinematic sensibilities of modesty and nuance). It is unabashedly pro-gay in its overtones.   That being said, it does a helluva job showing the painful family dynamics that drive children to seek love and acceptance in others the rest of their lives, and, all too commonly, in the addictions that are an attempt to fill the hole in their hearts.  It is a gritty, hard-hitting look at the human struggle for meaning and acceptance of anyone who has been abused in childhood.  It is an unflinching examination of the brutal consequences of our poor choices in our search for real love and the denial we bury ourselves in along the way as we cope with the  betrayal of those we should be able to trust.    With a world that has consistently grown more selfish, many,  many people will be able to see themselves (their pain and struggle) in this movie. My prayer is they will also do the hard work neccesary to confront their demons, stop running from their pain and the truths of their lives,  and own their self-destructive choices so as to be able stop the abuse cycle and to find, give and receive true love in this life.  May this movie be an inspiration to the wounded to walk through the fire of honest, hard-core therapy to a place of healing and wholeness.   As a survivor, who is ""still standing,"" and who has run the therapy gauntlet to face down a past that drove me to create my own personal hell, I can attest, with Elton John, it is totally worth it.    (Just know from the outset the scars and coping tendencies remain for life, they just don't control/drive you anymore.  You become much more free to choose your life.)  *My only complaint about this movie, which boldly addresses the horrific realities of addictions, is its use of graphic sex scenes that ironically feed our cultural pornographic sex addictions.

2019-06-08T21:24:33Z,"I would very much like Hollywood to do a biopic on Jared Fogle, the former Subway spokesperson and now convicted felon,  roly-poly-boy-toy and daily punching bag for any number of his fellow inmates at the federal penitentiary in Englewood, Colorado.   Perhaps it too could  be a musical.  One of the numbers could be called ""Smaller Pants,"" and two different versions could both open and close the production.  In the beginning, Jared sings ""I wanna get in smaller pants,"" in reference to his desire to lose weight by eating only veggie subs.  At the end prior to his arrest, as he's flying around the country molesting children, he could sing the same line, but it would of course have a far more sinister meaning.   Another number could involve a couple of parents going to the authorities to report that their pre-adolescent son has been victimized by Fogle.  The song could be titled ""He Went to Jared.""   You see, I'm a dead ringer for Fogle.   We're talking ""separated at birth"" identical.   Up until November, 2015 I had a fairly steady part time gig posing as him and entertaining at kids' birthday parties.  For a reasonable fee, I'd provide the entertainment (balloon animals and showing the kids the former pants with a 48 inch waistline that ""Jared"" used to have to wear before he started eating Subway veggies subs everyday) and the food (a Subway platter). Needless to say, my tax returns for the past few years have shown a fairly significant reduction in income. My last gig was just after Thanksgiving in 2015. The people who had booked me had paid a deposit in advance, so they went ahead and had me come out with my balloons and five foot cold cut with six toppings on  Italian herb bread.  I ended up getting mauled by their German Shepherd who had been watching CNN a week or so earlier.

And the songs weren’t in sequence with the time periods which would've made more sense as it would show his music progressing as he progressed.   There were a few emotional moments meant to tug at the heartstrings but overall, I didn't really enjoy it like I did Bohemian Rhapsody. I think the reason Rocketman got such high ratings was due to the fact that it didn't shy away from the love scenes like BR did but even Rocketman love scenes were pretty tame as I would have expected they'd go all out in Elton John fashion but they didn’t.",0,0,tupacamaru2

Could they have kept more to the story, less of the little kid. More FULL concert songs. Give me a break! This reminded me so much of “Beyond The Sea” horrible. All I wanted was Bobby Darin and Sandra Dee’s story. Told in normal dialogue. Not song and dance. And a Buck tooth kid as a young Bobby with made up drama. With Rocketman I expected more concert scenes, less of the little boy crap ( who ever has a perfect childhood? Spare me the violins)  at least the actor who played Elton was way cuter than Elton himself and even had a better voce.",0,0,65motowngirl
2019-06-04T21:04:25Z,I like the film a lot but I said in my review that it tries to match John's songs with what's happening in that particular scene and it doesn't really work. Songs in musicals are usually very clear in their meaning and they're  used to advance the plot or explain a character. John's music is more vague and interpretable than that. But the music's good so I find myself not caring that much. Great performance by Taron Egerton.,0,0,LukeToTheMovies

Trailer:  https://youtu.be/PO5q2lfdCC4      IMDB:  https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120879/?ref_=ttpl_pl_tt Bowie initially cooperated with the film until he learned the script was based on two unauthorized biographies, one of them by his ex-wife, Angie. At that point Bowie pulled his support, the licensing for his music, and threatened a lawsuit. So Bowie became Brian Slade (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) and Ziggy Stardust became Maxwell Demon. The Curt Wild character (Ewan McGregor) is an amalgamation of mostly Iggy Pop with bits of Lou Reed, and Angie became Mandy (Toni Collette).

2019-06-01T19:36:23Z,"I thought 'Rocketman' was average at best.  I didn't hate it.  But it seemed as though the filmmakers tried so hard to break the biopic mold by having people break out in song and dance every time they were in danger of committing the 'biopic cliche crime'.  It was too distracting for me.  The song/dance breaks felt like an excuse rather than a natural extension of the scene.  To me, 'La La Land' is the perfect mold for how a musical should be done.  The singing and dancing was used sparingly and only when the scene absolutely demanded it.  Anyway, I personally felt that 'Bohemian Rhapsody' was a better film.  It's too bad filmmakers are so beholden to the pompous critics.  In bending over backwards to appease the critics, they only suck the joy out of film.",1,4,The Dude Abides

And on top of all of that, its a musical and every actually intense and inspiring scene is constantly interrupted by a song. The movie doesnt show him writing any of his greatest hits once....

2019-05-30T17:47:22Z,"I plan on seeing this movie on its release, have always loved Elton John, started listening to him back in 1973. In the mid-70s, everything that he and Bernie Taupin touched turned to gold. Very few performers last as long as Reginald Dwight. I noticed that the trailer never played “Rocket Man,” which is ironic since that’s the name of the biopic. Anyway, looks like a good movie and hope it is.",0,0,wlhardy

I was honestly not a big Elton John fan, I always admired him for living out loud and never being afraid to be himself, but his music didn't do much for me.   After seeing his movie, I have a new appreciation for his music and for him.  His story is so compelling and the way the movie was made is very unique with the transitions between scenes and the musical performances.   Taron Egerton is so great as Elton including with all the singing.   Even if you are not a fan of his music I highly recommend seeing this movie.    It really moved me emotionally and I was not expecting that at all.",12,0,Dancefloor Mayhem

Some people may be worried about the ""R"" rating... but trust me, the film benefits from this rating, because it gave the filmmakers the freedom to really delve into Elton John's life (unlike ""Bohemian Rhapsody,  which had a ""PG-13"" rating, and definitely would've benefited from an ""R""), while also not being overly or gratuitously graphic in any way.

Unlike Bohemian Rhapsody, they don't try to cover up the low points of Elton's life. It being a musical also helps to let us hear more of the songs. The songs also usually had to do with the plot and weren't thrown in willy nilly, which was nice. Bernie Taupin also gets his fair share of credit. My dad, who had seen Elton John on his first American tour, really enjoyed it as well. Highly recommend.   Also, can people shut up about the gay sex scene? It's 15 seconds and there's zero nudity.

On the big screen Because they managed to stay grounded with all the fame at an early age plus continued to have success after 50 years.!! And have always been great role models. Can't wait for Rocketman, David Bowie would be great. What about JOURNEY movie that is when Steve Perry was with group. Billy Joel movie as well. These are just some of the greats that have lasted over 50 years that is amazing in this industry. A Ronnie Milsap movie would be really great as well.! The Stevie Wonder of Country music. But mixes soul pop ect in his music plays the piano. Then can sing a good traditional country song so easy what a great he is. This groups and solo artists deserve to be given an honorary  Grammy for all they have done.

It just kind of spoils the originality..( I mean it's my personal perception) not that the new one comes better but it's just spoiling...

I'm not saying he's any less of a great artist than Freddie Mercury, but honestly he already has a lot of money and doesn't need a movie to make people know about him. Let's make movies about David Bowie or John Lennon and the Beatles, to make their legacies live on forever, but I honestly think that there's still time to make a film about Elton John.

2019-03-04T22:18:33Z,"Here's something I noticed in this trailer. There are a few moments which are straight from real documented parts of Elton's life, like the music video to ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart"" at 0:59 and his wedding to Renate Blauel at 1:51. In these scenes, little details are off, like Elton's suit patterns, Kiki's dungarees, and Renate's dress color. I feel like this is supposed to be part of the ""fantasy"" element of the film. It's not a frame-for-frame recreation, but rather Elton's life filtered through his own vision.    If the film has any nuance like that, I'm going to love it! As many people have already pointed out, music biopics are very formulaic, to the point of parody.

But it also looks promising because Elton does have rich history of good songs behind him. Who know maybe Taron could get his first Oscar nomination. But if there’s one thing they should do better than Bohemian Rhapsody is to not gloss over Elton’s sexuality. Don’t make it the focal point but at the same time don’t hide it like Bohemian Rhapsody did. Either way I’m looking forward to seeing what this movie bring to the table.,0,0,Donovan Last Star

The piano man himself, Billy Joel. Seriously, I think it's time he got recognition.  The biopic would chronicle his early life and childhood, showing his early struggles (cold spring harbor, suicide attempt, etc.) and would lead into the creation of some of his most famous albums being created, like Piano Man, The Stranger, or 52nd Street, and show his personal life and struggles that led him to create storm front or river of dreams. I don't know who would play him, I've always thought if Michael Keaton were younger he could nail the looks, but that's just me, I'm still working on that part. I'd also love to see concert he did in Russia re created, right down to the scene of him flipping the piano.  That's just my idea, you may take from it what you like",0,0,JoeJoe

But, my dad was the one to introduce me to such iconic people like Elton and although I am not a huge fan, I blame it on pop influence, I know who he is, I listen to his music, I applaud him for what he has done and continues to do.
