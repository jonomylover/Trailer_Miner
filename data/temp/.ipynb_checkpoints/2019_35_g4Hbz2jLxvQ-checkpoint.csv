2019-02-27T16:48:26Z,"Watched it yesterday, it's been a long time since I laughed and cried at the same time with a movie. The way it invigorates and reaffirms Spidey's cultural relevance  without abandoning its tone and sequential narrative is a work of deliberate art (the only one worth praising).  It gave me powerful Ninja Theory's DmC:  Devil May Cry vibes (the psychedelic palette, transitions between dimensions, the inverted falling scene, pretty obvious), along with anime film Paprika (a color explosion, almost literally). Truly amazing movie.   The only downside was, as usual, how Americans misinterpret anime style and conventions: (All good with a character like Peni Parker, but it really looks like a bad emulated anime style, and it shows A LOT as usual) They fail at character frames, proportions, eyes' size and expressions... and it seems they always will (Amerimanga SUCKS horribly), but Spider-Man's Noir conundrum with the Rubik Cube hypercompensated those shortcomings for me.  Great, great piece of work; let's hope nobody starts ripping off this style... I think Steve Ditko would've been proud.",0,0,Horus SC

2019-02-24T20:50:13Z,What I think people don‚Äôt realize is that animation is not supposed to be realistic it‚Äôs supposed portray the real world in a distorted more interesting way. What many studies do now is make everything soo realistic that it stops becoming animation. It‚Äôs cool when you see water in incredibles II look more realistic than real life but at that moment it‚Äôs not even recognizeable as animation. The way that I would describe animation is that it‚Äôs -‚Äúa drawing and not a picture‚Äù and the many ‚Äúimprovements‚Äù that we make can actually be   disadvantages when I see animated movies I don‚Äôt expect to see a computer generated clone of him but I want to see simple creative and in many ways more beautiful than real life while still being in every way less detailed the thing I want to say is *animation is a drawing and not a picture*,3,0,Chlopaczek Hula

2019-01-22T11:34:13Z,"My thoughts after seeing the movie are listed below:   Well, where do I start with this movie? Being an almost flawless origin story exploring Miles Morales struggles and his coming to terms with new founded super skills, it was set beautifully through the comic book animations. The film is the best film of 2018 and I really want to watch it a 5th time.    Well, I'm not really familiar with the comic books about Miles Morales, but I do consider myself an amateur Spider-Man fan, growing up watching Tobey Maguire defeat his opponents in the Sam Raimi trilogy. But this one was by far the best Spider-Man movie anyone could really ask for.     The humor is spectacularly displayed through the animation world of Spider-Verse, which to replicate in live action would be quite impossible. The input of thought bubbles was an amazing idea to see the progression and the thoughts from Miles. Seeing Miles Morales own clumsiness as he battles through what he calls puberty, and his old middle age Spider-Man mentor Peter B Parker's crusty experience and his self-doubt of being able to teach Morales adds to the humor. And adding onomatopoeia, including having bagel as onomatopoeia was also quite humorous.    This film well and truly explores the coming of age of a new Spider-Man who has more powers than the original. Focusing the spotlight on an Afro-Latino teenager, we are subjected to a soundtrack for the movie with a genre that is currently really popular even amongst young teenagers being hip-hop. The film doesn't fail to adequately describe how Miles Morales, a normal unexpecting teenager in the streets of Brooklyn, learns how to deal with superpowers that he had probably never wanted. But to really find himself, he goes through an emotional rollercoaster that triggers him finding himself.     My review would not be based much on the other characters but more on what this film was set to do; introduce Miles Morales. So in the film, for each different Spider-Men we see, we have a brief summary of their background, which allows for more character development. Except Miles' story is still being produced. The film's plot was almost flawless. The reason why I would say this is not because it was really much of a flaw, but something I would recommend on improving. Throughout the film, we can also see Miles' family problems, in being that Miles favors his uncle, Aaron Davis more than his own father, Jefferson Davis. We could see through the characters emotions that he has a special relationship with Aaron Davis, but the audience could not really sympathize with him much (well really me). SPOILER ALERT, when Aaron Davis was shot dead by Kingpin, we could see the hysteria caused by the non-diegetic sounds and the sadness dying in the arms of Miles. But personally, I couldn't really find that emotion. What I felt was that it was due to a lack of screen time for Aaron Davis. Its simple, we don't see him enough to miss him enough. A great example of this would be Wonder Woman. When Wonder Woman meets the pilot, she becomes acquainted with the pilot and the pilot shares a lot of screen time. When he dies at the end, both the audience and character feels the loss and empathize for the person dead. However, I felt that this was Spider Verse's most major flaw, and it is not even a flaw, just to show you how good this movie is.    What I did feel amazed by is how after the death and his failing to prove himself, he gets back up. Perhaps,  the thing that brought tears to my eyes was when Jefferson Davis gives Miles a mini-speech behind the door at the academy. The non-diegetic music adds to the sadness, and the father confessing to him about how much he pushed Miles because he sees a spark in him that is amazing really touches the heart. Obviously, this boost only sparks his powers, with which he finds out by taking a ""leap of faith"".     Being a spectacular Spider-Man film, which beautifully describes how a teenager finds himself, I would have to conclude by saying that Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse a solid movie.",34,2,KoreanJunkie365

I probably would have told you he was crap and that another Spiderman that wasn‚Äôt Peter Park would be crap.  I actually decided to pick up one of Miles Morels comics, read it and to my surprise I actually really enjoyed it.     Went to Into the Spider Verse last night and I honestly really enjoyed it.  Probably the best Spiderman film to date. Real liked the story and the plot.  I may have gotten a little emotional when the original Spiderman died.  The female Doc Oc really surprised me which I thought was pretty cool.  Kingpin looked really weird and was huge but fun to watch.      Movie was really good .  Really good movie to take the kids to.  Highly recommend and I hope this is the start of something new.  Hope they decide to make some more.",8,1,Joe Dirt

The song was really cool and I'd like to hear it again. Does anyone know the name to it?,93,6,Riri Pari

After watching the movie earlier today, I came home to watch the trailer.   From the animation style, screenplay, action, relationship between the characters, and everything in between, this movie was really entertaining.   I didn't think Sony had it in them, but the screenplay by Phil Lord and Rodney Rothman delivered. We cannot forget the great work from directors Peter Ramsay, Rodney Rothman, and Bob Persichetti. This isn't just a cool animated movie, but it's also an overall cool film. I am looking forward to the sequel.",2977,30,lovewhispers68

2018-12-06T21:27:36Z,This reminds me of the lego movie. Not anything with the story but with the way they animate it. In the lego movie they limited themselves to using only real lego pieces (with exceptions of clouds and the real humans) and in this movie you can see they use a weird dot effect(1:45) which was on comic books because it was cheaper to print it like that. Also there are BOOMs on the screen (0:00) like when a superhero punched someone it went pow. I have never seen this style of animation before and i hope sony pictures makes a comeback from the emoji movie,1,1,Lil Shagur

So again, until you upgrade the tech tree for the police you idiots should be grateful for heroes like Spiderman risking their lives for no money while doing your jobs.   There's dumb and there's Marvel comics human dumb.   I mean let's say you do arrest or shoot him. What happens next time when Green Goblin or some other crazy villain is destroying the city and you police can't do squat? Who'll save you all then idiots?

Miles Morales is a boy that also got bitten by the same spider and has to succeed Peter Parker, becoming his own Spider-Man. Gwen Stacy, while not in the same universe (although it's called ""Into the Spider-Verse"" for a reason) also became a Spider-Woman. If an agenda doesn't get shoved down my throat, I'm fine with this movie. I mean, he's gonna be in a costume so it's not like the public will judge the new Spider-Man for being black, just a new kid. They might make the public judge the suit, it being black instead, but we can see that Peter already has had that suit in his collection.",0,0,Bootleg

I dont agree with the director's opinions and statements he's made on Twitter, but you have to realize he wasn't the only one who made the movie. The voice actors, animators, the studio, the musicians, they also helped bring this to life. They deserve their recognition for the hard work they've done instead of their work being ignored because of the person who's running the project. If the director makes a mistake the entire team shouldn't have to suffer too. That's like if the quarterback of your favorite NFL team said something horrible, the rest of the team shouldn't have to suffer because of someone else's actions. If you still dont want to see the movie, that's fine it's your choice. But dont let the actions of one person on a team make or break your opinion of a movie.",0,1,Starling Skys

2018-08-04T05:05:59Z,I have a little theory. The Peter Parker is from a different dimension. Why you may ask? Well Peter is suppose to be dead. Maybe the reason he can't pay for his food is because he left his wallet back in his dimension. Also when Miles sees Peter he looks like he's seen a ghost. Also one last thing at the end when Spidy mentioned comic con Miles is so baffled by it because it doesn't exist in his dimension. Well um that's all I could pice together so if you find anything to help this theory tell me or tell me flaws about the Idea of this theory.,22,7,Sleepyhead

My theory is that, this Spider-Man is the Peter Parker of the Ultimate Universe, who dies and we see his grave in the teaser. (Well we know he dies in the Ultimate universe so it is one more reason that it may be true) and the second Spider-Man we see as Peter Parker in 1:09 is the one in the Original Universe (I don't remember its name so sorry!) that somehow came over to the Ultimate universe and decided to teach Miles, hence he is an adult, since Ultimate Peter Parker died at his teen years.

2018-06-27T20:59:09Z,"It seems that Into the Spider-Verse will be introducing viewers to Miles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore) as he grows into his role as Spider-Man, mentored by an older, more inveterate take on Peter Parker (voiced by Jake Johnson) than any we‚Äôve seen before.  Not only will Miles Morales ‚Äî the Afro-Latinx teen who became the first non-white iteration of the swinging superhero with Marvel‚Äôs Ultimate line of comics in 2011 ‚Äî be taking to the streets of New York in Into the Spider-Verse, but there‚Äôs also a glimpse of Spider-Gwen. She‚Äôs another popular take on the character in yet another universe where Gwen Stacy gets the radioactive spider-powers instead.    I‚Äôd be remiss in not pointing out that the art style of the film is absolutely gorgeous, with a textured, brightly colored vibe that looks like someone blended a comic book with Pixar-style 3D animation.   The new trailer also gives a bit more context about the setting of Into the Spider-Verse for fans who might not be as well-versed in the universe-hopping shenanigans of comic books. According to Morales‚Äô voiceover, the film takes place in ‚Äúanother universe, that looks and sounds like yours ‚Äî but it‚Äôs not.‚Äù (So don‚Äôt expect to see Tom Holland‚Äôs incarnation of the character swinging through the streets.)  ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" new trailer was released alongside  ""Incredibles 2"" In U.K. & Ireland Cinema Locations ""Ant Man and the Wasp"" ""Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation"" ""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"" In AMC Theaters Locations ""Christopher Robin"" ""Alpha"" ""A-X-L"" & ""The House With a Clock in its Walls  If you saw this trailer read the Replies below",0,0,Manic More Est. 2003

2018-06-18T00:01:38Z,So is this just an excuse to cast a black person as a new spiderman. I am not racist in any sense but I do not recall this happening in the comics an older Spiderman teaching a new kid. I am not saying spiderman can not be a black person but when you start making films that purposley cast black actors or change male roles into female just to please years of biased in films. I would be more happy if they came up with their own unique identities for new characters for these people not use exicting ones but change race or gender.  It is just lazy hollywood knowing we know a series already so if we created a new world people would be disinterested.,0,2,Fender Mustango

2018-06-14T23:07:00Z,I think that Josh Keaton voices the main Spiderman that gets killed then the lazy Peter played by that one dude comes into this universe and miles tells him that this isn't his universe. So like the Amory and the news reports about Spider-Man is actually a younger Spider-Man thats originally in the same universe as miles and this new old Spider-Man is looked at as the same as the old peter so miles asks for his help and all that.,0,0,Haha Jenkins

2018-06-14T22:10:24Z,Okay Marvel I see you trying to upgrade on your animation side. They need to use more of this style for their animation side. Me and hubby always debate cuz he is a DC fan and I am more Marvel but I do admit DC was always winning in the animated movies and shows department. So hopefully Marvel step its games up and this actually gives me hope for that. Marvel animated shows that were good were the 80s Xmen and Spiderman. But doing more animated movies like Justice league movies but instead with Xmen and other marvel groups would be dope to see.,0,1,cubana4ever

He sulked for a while and tried to live a normal life thus the scene where he hugged his dad. suddenly the big battle going on and Miles join Peter  and Gwen. Peter dies, Miles change into his own outfit and become the spiderman.  It either that, or a bunch of moments in the comics combine to an extraordinary movie.",0,0,Johnathan Holmes

2018-06-10T10:37:08Z,"The dad is maybe the best character I have seen in years. Love every single thing about him.  Miles looks great too. Maybe even better then the original.  Peter.. I don't really like this version so far, but the 90s Peter Parker beeing my alltime favorit hero of all time makes me obviously bias. As a mentor he might be pretty interesting.  Gwen could be great. I liked the Spider-Gwen character in the comics so there is potential.  The villans so far look stupid. I never liked the Ultimate Green Goblin monster and the Kingpin (if this even is him) is a little much too. Especially because it looks like his size doesn't even matter when he is thrown around just like anybody else is.. The kid in the cape.. don't recognise him. He looks cool so I'm optimistic.  Music, artstyle, animation.... everything looks really good.  conclusion: I am hyped and I hope Sony will do more awesome stuff like this with the license instead of chasing the big movie crowd. Just as DCs animated movies are awesome and deserve more recognition while their movies are just bad..",0,1,Errtuabyss

2018-06-09T16:25:32Z,"Year 257,834 of no fap: My brain has grown to gargantuan size and is now about the size of a bowling ball. I am now able to see into the future where I will rule over all of humanity as a deity. My cognitive capacity has eclipsed that of Albert Einstein by one hundred million megafaggots.However, due to the fact that my brain is still growing, my muscle tissue is rapidly deteriorating as my muscle tissues are transforming into brain cells to support my immense intelligence and as a result, I will soon be reduced to a vegetative state where I will be able to warp space-time through my new knowledge of quantum physics.My knowledge of astrophysics has rocketed one million years ahead of anyone on the planet. Through this new knowledge, I unlocked the ability to warp gravity. With this new ability I was able to rip a hole in the space-time continuum to create wormholes that I have placed on the edge of the Kuiper Belt that lies beyond our solar system. In one of these wormholes I have discovered an alternate universe.In this universe I have discovered an earth in which homosexuals staged a coup d‚Äôetat against the international government and have taken over the world. I have studied the peoples for many years and have come to the conclusion that this is what our earth was meant to be. When I return to our earth, I will use my powers and research to create an advanced society of Chads that will become a level five galactic race that will rule over all other beings.You may be asking, what beings shall we rule? Do not fear, I have used my intuition to devise a perfect plan. First I will release a mega nut with the force of to big bangs. And then, with my understanding of the solar nebula theory, a solar system identical to ours will form through the colliding of planetesimal particles to form exoplanets that will resemble the planets in our solar system.I will then accelerate time by warping the time in the universe therefore speeding up the evolution process. I will then travel to the exoplanet version of earth and impregnate the first female with my ultimate hypernut that will travel with the max velocity of five Saturn V rockets.",2,0,I'm The Smartest Human Being

I know BR didn't do what studios probably wanted it to, but its slowly being discovered and everyone liked it better than sw.  Hopefully Blu ray sales show that. at least my love for the film surpasses what anyone thinks about it, I saw it 4 times in the cinema, and bought 2 copies on blu ray, posters, books, the replica collectors edition blaster.   Blade runner, deserves more. and I bet more people will see the next one because before not many had faith it wouldn't be turned into some action film..

2018-06-09T03:19:52Z,"Okay so here's my own personal theory with whats going on here especially with the two different Spiderman voices: The Peter we see in the diner with the burger looks much older than most incarnations, rather looking in his 20s he has graying hair it could be in his 40s+. We also see later on at the Gwen Stacy segment that he doesn't apparently have a full costume and neither does miles. Yet later we see Miles explaining the multiverse with ""Two Spidermen"" to who we assume is another Peter.  So I think whats going to happen is that there are 2 universes that will be delved upon (probably a LOT more with this Gwen Stacy reveal), Old Parker (with Miles) and Young Parker (no miles). In the old Parker universe he is near the end of his career, he has all the suits from the comics and the public knows who he is. Miles gets bitten and goes through his origin, EXCEPT Peter takes him on as a sidekick or protege. However in some sort of fight (possibly ending with miles being sent through to the Young Parker universe) Old Parker will die (thus the Peter Parker grave stone in the first trailer). Beforehand I think Old Parker may introduce Miles to the idea of a Multiverse (assuming that this Parker is a future 'Version' of the 616 one and has done interdimensional stuff before). For whatever reason, Miles will be sent to a universe where there is still a inexperienced spiderman. The one who asks ""How is this possible"".  Alternatively this could be the the other way around, Miles lives in the young Parker universe as a rookie but is sent to old Parker universe and learns.   Probably wrong but that's my take on things.",1,0,Emulator

2018-06-09T00:30:18Z,I haven't read miles comic but I got spoiled that the og spidey died inspiring mile to be him (cause spidey was his mentor) so how exactly does this work? Another thing is wouldnt the og Spiderman (like the one who doesn't die and is in the original timeline and universe) know who spider gwen or rather the name GWEN STACY is? I mean he saw her die right? I also have 2 more concerns is anyone willing to tell me how the other spideys get into miles universe? And doesn't that mean the original Spiderman (original universe and timeline that's going in now) come to help? And 2ND wouldn't one of these spideys know every single Spiderman as Spiderman had already went through a time where he call multiple spideys to fight a group of villains?,0,0,LuckyDiesel3

I also love how fluid the animation is. Disney's Tangled was supposed to have a look like this originally when it was still called ""Rapunzel Unbraided"", to make it look like a painting in motion, but they went for the generic CGI look instead. I would never expect for a Spiderman movie to go with this look, but I'm impressed that they did! I would love to see this movie!",5,0,Brianna Wilson

2018-06-08T05:42:09Z,"*Hey you!*          Hi, I'm TakeTheJurny, just a fellow small Youtuber with a big dream >_< I can't explain how much this means to me that you are giving me your time just to read this comment, and I know you probably are ready to go see a different video or maybe just look at your phone but, it really does mean a lot, because in our society time is very precious. So thanks for reading. Now that I've got your full attention. *M-MHM* I have worked very hard on my Youtube but I fear that the new rules and regulations and the terrible ""adpocalypse"" are going to be hard to surpass by taking the classic ""Make a viral video"" seems. So I have decided to comment here, on a viral video, and yes some may say this is advertising, and perhaps it is but please, hear me out. Right now there are 31,139 comments on this video. If every single person that commented on this video saw this comment and took a look at my channel and subscribed literally my dreams would come TRUE!!!! I mean, think about that for a second, we all, working together could make MY DREAMS COME TRUE! and I'm not even asking everyone to subscribe because I only want people who truly enjoy my work to sub, and I'm perfectly fine with that! I'm just trying to find the fastest and easiest way to give everyone a chance to see my work and enjoy it, as well as better my chances for growing as a Youtuber! Now let me rephrase my dream, just so you truly understand my goal...(also thanks so much for still reading!).   *FLASHBACK NARRATION SCENE OF ME AS A LITTLE KID*  I had a rough childhood. My father hurt me and my mom for 13 crappy years, crazy right? It finally shook my mom and she left, but I loved my dad still so much I stayed even though it totally sucked because he'd constantly hurt me, and I don't want to get too detailed because, well, kids might be reading-- anyways, that plus I was always outcasted from my classmates in school and I was pretty much stuck watching Netflix and eating to have fun at the time. It was always hard for me to see the bright side of things and I was losing hope as I sunk deep in to a sort of young depression. That is until I found something.. So I had never really watched Youtube at the time and I thought it was kind of boring tbh. But I was crying that day and looking for enjoyment. Then it was on the screen. ""Markiplier's Let's Play Slender The Arrival!"" I was so excited because I LOVED Slenderman so much, so with that in mind I clicked, not knowing what was to happen...but what would happen, would change my life forever. (Hey just another thumbs up for still reading!! I know it's a lot sorry!!).   As I watched Markiplier, as I listened to his positive glow and saw his bright booming smile as he squealed at different things about the game. I noticed something starting to change. I had stopped crying. I was also now smiling, focused and laughing at the video! Ever since then I kept watching his videos WHENEVER I was down, or sad or unhappy. His videos never failed to lift me up and cleanse me of my darkness. As he wandered down dark corners bravely, I wandered with him. Like a family. I wanted to share this feeling of happiness. This feeling of peace even in chaos! I wanted anyone like me to see this so that they would be happy too, so that we could all be positive and for once have some sort of universal truth of peace and a wonderful family. I want to do what he does. I want to make YOU smile when no one else is. YOU laugh on a bad day. and YOU can be my family when yours isn't there for you. (SORRY I'LL HURRY THIS UP! Dang you still reading? wow!)   So, my dream is to be what Markiplier was to me. A light in a person's darkness. I just want to make everyone laugh and bring everyone together. So that's why I made my Youtube. TakeTheJurny, because life is a Journey. Now I just want to say that this is not spam, this is a choice. No one has to sub I just wanted everyone to have a chance to see my Youtube before it hits 1million, and that will happen one day :) thanks for reading, and as always I will see you, when I heed the call, to the next Journey, Adios guys! <3 and thanks so much for reading!",3,2,TakeTheJurny

You ignored my advice and rejected the correction I offered. So I will laugh when you are in trouble! I will mock you when disaster overtakes you - when calamity overcomes you like a storm, when you are engulfed by trouble, and when anguish and distress overwhelm you. I will not answer when they cry for help. Even though they anxiously search for me, they will not find me. For they hated knowledge and chose not to fear the Lord. They rejected my advice and paid no attention when I corrected them. That is why they must eat the bitter fruit of living their own way. They must experience the full terror of the path they have chosen. For they are simpletons who turn away from me - to death. They are fools, and their own complacency will destroy them.

Spider-Man used to be one of my favourite comics in childhood. Today I don‚Äôt read or watch much of the ‚Äúsuperheroes‚Äù stuff, I am just not into it. Really. But I even watched the first Maguire movie back in 2001 on cinema (it ended up to be the whole trilogy, just like with LotR). Back then I felt the same thing I felt now watching this trailer.

2018-06-07T21:15:29Z,Thing is in first trailer miles morales is standing in front of peter parkers grave so could that mean this old peter could have died after mentoring miles and he's the true heir after peter parker. This could also mean why miles is so desperately in search for the prowler and goes through any other villain trying to protect or have any info on him hence kingpin and green goblin. This is just my thoughts and off course i know in miles' universe peter is dead but i just thought the dialogue between miles and peter first meeting was a little odd like he's never heard of whos behind the mask before and what would happen if he relived peters death twice.

2018-06-07T20:52:29Z,"So this is my analysis/theory: Miles is just your ordinary kid blah blah blah, maybe he's interested in Spider-Man but his dad definitely isn't. But he somehow gets bit by the radioactive spider, and one day he gets caught in the middle of a fight between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin and Spider-Man rescues him and finds out Miles is the same as him. So Miles is being tutored by Peter and maybe one by one more Spider Dudes show up? But there was that one clip where Peter is fighting a purple Spider guy (maybe) but then in one clip when they're training they meet Spider-Gwen. Also Peter seems to where his suit in public so maybe people know his identity. I saw Kingpin in there too. So maybe with the more Spider Guys showing up there might dimensional traveling or alternate villains show up too. I kinda hope I'm wrong so I'm more surprised bit also some details are true.

I understand what y‚Äôall are feeling, because I‚Äôve felt that feeling for like literally every single MCU movie, I just am not getting that feeling from this trailer. Also am I the only one who is seriously worried that this movie is not going to be nearly as good as everyone is thinking its going to be? From the stuff they‚Äôve been revealing in the trailers, to the name of the movie, to rumors about other movies and spin-offs, it seems like they‚Äôre trying to do a lot, and I mean A LOT, in this movie, and thats all exciting and awesome... if it works. Thats a big ‚Äúif‚Äù. With all that they‚Äôre trying to do in this movie, there is so much that can go wrong. I just would hate if it was a waste of time money and resources for Sony and Marvel, and a waste of time and money for us. Also it will just take up space at comic con.",0,1,John Lopez

2018-06-07T16:52:16Z,"(JESUS): Unless a man is BORN AGAIN he will NOT see the KINGDOM OF GOD!): (John 3:3).   (Washing of regeneration/HOLY SPIRIT/What it means on being BORN AGAIN):   ***The regenerative activity of the Holy Spirit is characterized elsewhere in scripture as cleansing and purifying.   ***(Ezekiel 36:25-27)<---Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.   ***(John 3:5)<---(Jesus)<---Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.   ***The Greek term for regeneration literally means ""being born again""---indicating a new birth effected by the Holy Spirit.   ***(John 3:6)<---(Jesus)<---That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.   ***(Romans 8:16)<---The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:   ***(Galatians 4:6)<---And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son (((into your hearts))), crying, Abba, Father.   ***Thus God saved us through one process with two aspects:   ***(1): The washing of regeneration  And   ***(2): The renenwing of the Holy Spirit.   But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man has not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. (Romans 8:9).   (Jesus): But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. (John 14:26).  Then opened he/Jesus their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures. (Luke 24:45).   (So, Jesus has to open your mind so you can understand and comprehend what the HOLY BIBLE is saying).   (Jesus): Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. (Revelation 3:20).   (Jesus): I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.   (John 8:24). JESUS=Son of God=God.  Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.(John 3:3).   (Being born again is being born of the HOLY SPIRIT of God. And if you don't have the HOLY SPIRIT you will go to HELL and end up in the LAKE OF FIRE).   And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him. (Acts  5:32).   And if you don‚Äôt have the Holy Spirit, which the wise virgins have in Matthew Chapter 25, you will not be raptured when Jesus returns for his church and you will be left behind to face  Hell on earth with the Anti-Christ‚Ä¶.",0,0,mlzanercik

In the first trailer, it showed Miles standing in front of a grave stone with the initials P.P. on it, hiding the rest of the name in shadow. Which we all thought it was Peter Parker, as in the comics, Spider-Man died in Miles universe. So I thought they would go with that storyline, which would have been really exciting. But the second trailer shows Spider-Man in his 40‚Äôs, possibly, and alive. Which kind of is a bit of a spoiler and missed the chance to surprise us. Oh man Spider-Man‚Äôs dead?

2018-06-07T11:40:35Z,"This looks great. My issue with Sony is that is usually their pattern. First is awesome and everyone cheers and then they mess it up on round 2. They are like Michael Scott from the office, things are going well naturally then someone points it out and they try to hard or do to much to unnecessarily overcompensate and Boom you they got start from scratch again because they just f‚Äôd up...Michael Scott is hilarious though. That CGI TMNT (not the Michael bay one) I am talking the fully animated one some years back was a good example of doing an animated movie right. And they never made a sequel which to me is ok. If you can‚Äôt build a franchise at a consistent or growing level then it might not be worth building right?

Secondly there is apsoloutely no point as it has no place in the current marvel story line and finally marvel may not even ever include this plot idea into the actual story. There is quite literally no point in the creation of this except so Sony can make money. Ugh,0,0,Jinxs Void

2018-06-07T00:49:46Z,"[Black] People are getting excited about Spider-Man being black. As a black person who's very  ""aware""  of certain things I'm not going to get my hopes up yet. Why? Well, because even though everyone knows that Spider-Man is a superhero - in this case (unlike previous movies) he's not really going to be the sole star/hero of the show. He'd be sharing the spotlight with experts in the field of ""Superheroism"" and whilst the initial impression is, hey black people we gave you a superhero - they (the experts) will be the true stars / heroes and (positive) center of attention. My concern - since proven right in the past - is that  he will portrayed as the typical black person who: is naive (novice) / has self-doubt / is academically-challenged / has is siting on his gifts and talents and, therefore, needs to be mentored by a non-black person that will be responsible for educating / refining / gentrifying / uplifting / empowering .. him because - of course - he (the black person) would not be able to accomplish those things on his own or from other members of his (black) community.  Based on the trailer... there seems to be a somewhat subliminal black-on-black opposition  and crab-in-the-bucket thing going n when the (black) father is the one who's against (black) Spider-Man (his son). My concern is that people's subconscious would be triggered to think that he's another annoying black man trying to hold back progress for the good of the people.    ...and, yes, the conspiracy theorist in me is not wondering if someone is pushing more black superheros because their aware that more black folks will be willing to spend their ""liquid"" finances on cosplay and Halloween costumes.  That's not to say that I'm fighting anyone's hustle... I just want to be sure that black people are not exploited, mocked and taken for fools in the process. That said - though I'm no expert I have a great appreciation for animated shows - and great appreciation I mean LOVE... I no longer have the love I used for T.V shows and movies because of the very same issues mentioned above (and then some) but this movies has a lot of potential.",0,0,Empress Niques

But still that won't make sense because we still don't know how the Avengers survived Thanos or where Thanos is now. So my best guess is he entered the alternate universe and comes out of it to be this second Spider Man, and maybe enters the alternate universe to train with the Other dude.

2018-06-06T22:26:37Z,"*HERE'S THE TRUTH:* Romans 10:9-10: That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.  This means it's easy to get saved and gain eternal life. It's a matter of confession and belief. You must confess that God's Son, Jesus Christ, is Lord, and believe He died for your sins and God rose him from the dead.  Once you believe, all it takes is a simple prayer. Maybe something like this:  ""Lord Jesus, please save me, and give me eternal life. Amen.""  If you prayed that prayer sincerely, and you believe that God's Son Jesus died for your sins and that God rose him from the dead, you have eternal life... and you can never lose it! It's not about what we do, it's about what He did for us.  Ephesians 2:8-9: For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.  John 5:24: Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.  John 6:37: All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.   Now, once you believe, you become a child of God. You'll never see hell (even though our actions rightfully disqualify us from Heaven, once you believe, you accept the gift of eternal life and your sins are payed for, therefore you'll never go to hell). But, you can be an obedient or disobedient child. If you live a good life, you'll be blessed on the Earth, but if you live badly, God will chasten and punish you on the Earth. Even so, you will still go to Heaven.  Also, Jesus is the ONLY WAY to Heaven. If there were another way, He wouldn't have had to die for you and everyone.  John 14:6: Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.  Now, if you doubt the Bible, feel free to reply. The prophecies about Israel alone prove The Bible. If you want to hear about them, reply below and I will reply back.",1,2,Jesus Died For You

Miles Morales, probably one of the most one dimensional characters in Marvel Comics (mainly because he is basically just Peter Parker) is now getting a movie where he can finally distinct himself from Peter. Michael Bendis, the man who created the character Miles Morales was afraid to let Miles do anything on his own. Bendis made Miles always say (not always but sometimes) ‚ÄúGee, I wonder what Peter would do‚Äù or something like that. This movie might ignore that and instead ask ‚ÄúWhat would Miles Do‚Äù or something. If this is answered, the movie might finally make Miles Morales a better character and make him be better written better than the person who made him. That would be awesome.

2018-06-06T19:14:26Z,"At first I didn't care for the art style when I saw the first trailer, but I'm really liking it now.  Everything looks and seems great, except two things:  1. I don't like how they're portraying Peter Parker, I don't know what it is exactly, but something just feels off to me, I don't know if it's the voice actor, or the way he's teaching Miles, or what, but something is off.  2. I don't like them shoehorning in Spider-Gwen, this should've just been Miles's movie, the chance to bring him to a wider audience and have them get to know his character better and maybe even make him a better character in terms of not always being a copycat Peter Parker, now it seems (like classic Sony) they're trying to squeeze too much into one movie.  I hope these two points are dead wrong and it will turn out that Peter is the Peter we know and love and the inclusion of Spider-Gwen is natural and actually necessary to the plot of the movie, but given Sony's track record, and the fact that they needed Marvel's help to make good Spider-Man movies again...

2018-06-06T17:58:36Z,"1: I love the animation style, it literally looks like a comic book coming to life on screen 2: I don't love his voice, but Peter is spot on. He's broke enough to ask a kid to pay the bill. He understands and relays to Miles that the goal is to just protect innocent people, not save the entire world, just be the ""friendly neighborhood Spider-Man"". And in the end, he's wearing cargo pants, meaning he still loses pieces of his costume that he has to remake. 3: So glad Miles is finally on the big screen, and they nailed his character. He's a kid who gets embarrassed by his parents, but is sassy enough to still be confident as Spidey and question Peter's teaching methods. 4: Gwen Stacy isn't going to be just the girlfriend or smart nerdy girl, which is a major jump from her last cinematic appearance. Now we don't have to deal with the ""fridging"" problem. 5: I hope they really pull off the villains well, because it seems like there's gonna be a lot of them. The creature Peter was fighting is most likely Goblin or Lizard, not sure who the black suit guy was (Prowler, maybe), and I believe I saw the shadow of Kingpin in that explosion scene. 6: 1:57, we've all been there, Miles.",0,0,Nekron Prime

I think Sony has this idea to fill a movie with Hero‚Äôs because it‚Äôs worked for the MCU and they‚Äôve been wanting a Sinister Six Movie, which I also believe will not work. I feel if you add too many villains you are left with needing to add Heroes and the Heroes win anyways so what are you really doing? Making a giant wrestling match for a movie? Moderation Sony.

That has got to be the most hypocritical moment I‚Äôve ever seen since that one episode from Disney‚Äôs Ultimate Spider-man where Cloak and Dagger has some 1-dimensional trust issues instead of learning realistically to realize and acknowledge the facts they are not the only two costumed superhumans in existence without acknowledging that their Spider-Man is a costumed superhuman like them and that there are many like Cloak and Dagger out there in their Disney‚Äôs Ultimate Spider-verse instead treating Spider-man like an untrustworthy stranger with unusual powers when Cloak and Dagger equally be strangers with unusual powers themselves, and how come the writers have never bothered to write Disney-Ultimate Spidey‚Äôs Cloak and Dagger into developing fleshed out and relatable character development where cloak and dagger should have realized in a sensibly realistic hard way that Normal humans would have larger trust issues if they were more scared of superhumans as Cloak and Dagger would have some regular trust issues if they were more afraid of how normal humans would feel about them and learn to relate to superhumans of there kind like Spidey who could‚Äôve been more trustworthy to C&D because like Hershel Greene once said in that Walking Dead Video Game I once or twice played years ago, Hershel Greene: looks like you‚Äôre gonna have to rely on the honesty of strangers.",0,0,Husky Lemur

The animation style is beautiful and I like how they gave miles a personality  (unlike the comics where he is just some sjw prick) but the spider verse as the first spiderman animated movie? I could think of many more spiderman stories to do but I guess they have to draw in those young fans somehow and the only way to do that is give them the most recognizable name. I hope this doesn't come out to be some PC sjw shitshow.,23,6,PsychoMoFoGaming

2018-06-06T17:43:17Z,"Uh oh, I have some huge concerns now. Peter died in the Ultimate universe before ever meeting Miles. In fact, Miles kinda let him die in the comics. He had his powers and could have helped, but he didn't because he was scared. Now we see him being trained by Peter who looks like a bum and we've seen his tombstone in the first trailer...uh oh. Oh, and it's kinda dumb how Gwen stated her name right away when it should be a huge reveal to Peter (since she died in his universe).

But what about black cat having her own movie why not give established characters that displayed an already diverse marvel before Disney ever got involved and made it seems like they invented something that already existed. I didn't grow up thinking I wish there were a Latino Spider-Man otherwise I cannot appreciate the character I grew up appreciating this down on his luck nerd who had morals values and solid principles and a corny sense of humor. I did not care about his skin color I was not raised to be so shallow. If the social justice pandering was absolutely necessary the range of diverse characters already existed there was no need for any of these ""new and diverse""  characters that are rip offs of the originals. How about spiderman 2099. His name was Miguel O'Hara there you go or does it not count cause he was not fully Latin.

They help teach him . He creates his own suit and does his own stuff . After a fall out miles wants to do his own thing. This leads to spidergwen going back to her reality and peter fighting the SS alone and he dies. Feeling horrid guilt miles finally does what he should and becomes the new Spider-Man (prob the first half of the film) second half all miles main villain the prowler . At the end spidergwen returns and tells miles of Norman Osborne‚Äôs plan to go through the multiverse and kill or turn all the Spider-Men since he believes he‚Äôs there father. This sets up a sequel.

I do really like that this will be Mile's story, he's pretty unique and deserves some screen time. The only thing I do really hope for is that it stay pretty truthful to the comic's and each new chapter introduce a new Spider-Man with their own uniqueness/perspective on things until we eventually get the ""main"" Peter Parker introduced.

You see, each different spiderman you see is from a different universe in itself. So this spiderman isnt the same one from Infinity war, homecoming, or even the first three spiderman movies. In this universe, it's a little bit based off of the first spiderman movie, where peter is bit by a spider and gains these powers protecting new york. The main character, Miles Morales, also gets bit by a spider similar to Peter's. Later in the story, as seen from the first trailer, Peter dies. In the comic, he dies from the green goblin, but who knows what'll happen in this one?

And the animation style is gorgeous! Never seen anything like it. I can't even tell if it's 2D or 3D. It feels like a hybrid of both. And more than anything else I've seen this looks like a living breathing comic book on the big screen and that's really excited. Of course I'd like a good story but all I really need is for this to be fun and coherent.,277,6,Daddy Long Legs

2018-06-06T14:27:55.000Z,"Wow! This hurt to watch. I appreciate that they're going for a comic book look, but it's like they found some Ben-Day and halftone pattern plug-ins online and just slapped them on top of their existing animation and called it a day. Seriously, there are shots in here that look like they're supposed to be 3D and I'm not wearing the glasses. Some are just ridiculously blurry. No, not blurry. More just the same imagery on top of itself multiple times and then shifted slightly. What is actually good animation is buried under this garbage.  There there's whoever is voicing Peter. Jake Johnson according to Google? Sorry, but he sounds so flat and awful. You guys know this is an animated film right? I'm so fucking tired of hearing on camera actors, who can seemingly only act if they're on set, stumble awkwardly through a voice over role. Seriously, you couldn't have gotten Dan Gilvezan or Christopher Daniel Barnes or heck how about Neil Patrick Harris? You know, somebody who is older and has played Spider-Man before. Which is clearly what this version of him is supposed to be.  I'm also confused where this film is going. From the first teaser and the title, I thought this was going to be about the comic book event. But I guess they're just using the term ""Spider-verse"" because you got Peter, Miles, and Gwen in the same universe. But then why not just call it Ultimate Spider-Man? And what about the line about how ""in your universe there's only one Spider-Man...""? So is there going to be some universe hopping or not?",0,1,UltraPrimal

Miles had gained his powers right before Peter died and he was even there to witness Peter's death. He then was on his own and tried his hardest to become the next spider man. He had a good solo. THEN SPIDER VERSE HAPPENED. Peter was more of a Jedi ghost to Miles, Through newspapers and internet pictures, not right there with him at the start of his career. Later in his life he DID meet Peter even before SPIDER-VERSE. It was a run where Miles even fought alongside Peter against the monster that killed Peter in the first place (Green Goblin). It's not annoying but weird to me that they couldn't kill off Peter for this movie. Maybe this is another universe's Peter but still.",0,0,AfroBoiYT
